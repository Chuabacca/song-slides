# Show Us Christ

Prepare our hearts, O God  
Help us to receive  
Break the hard and stony ground  
Help our unbelief  

---

Plant Your Word down deep in us  
Cause it to bear fruit  
Open up our ears to hear  
Lead us in Your truth  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Your Word is living light  
Upon our darkened eyes  
Guards us through temptations  
Makes the simple wise  

---

Your Word is food for famished ones  
Freedom for the slave  
Riches for the needy soul  
Come speak to us today  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord

#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.

#The Glories of Calvary

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds  
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above  
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary
