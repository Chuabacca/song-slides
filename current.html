#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.

#The Glories of Calvary

---

Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more
  
Romans 5:20

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  
Romans 5:21

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds  
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above  
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory  
1 Peter 1:8

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

#Your Name

---

As morning dawns and evening fades  
You inspire songs of praise  
That rise from earth to touch  
Your heart and glorify Your Name

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name  

---

Jesus, in Your Name we pray  
Come and fill our hearts today  
Lord, give us strength to live for You  
And glorify Your Name  

---

Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name

But Your Name
