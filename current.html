#BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE

---

BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE  
I HAVE A STRONG AND PERFECT PLEA  
A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHOSE NAME IS LOVE  

---

WHO EVER LIVES AND PLEADS FOR ME  
MY NAME IS GRAVEN ON HIS HANDS  
MY NAME IS WRITTEN ON HIS HEART  

---

I KNOW THAT WHILE IN HEAV’N HE STANDS  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  

---

WHEN SATAN TEMPTS ME TO DESPAIR  
AND TELLS ME OF THE GUILT WITHIN  
UPWARD I LOOK AND SEE HIM THERE  

---

WHO MADE AN END OF ALL MY SIN  
BECAUSE THE SINLESS SAVIOUR DIED  
MY SINFUL SOUL IS COUNTED FREE  

---

FOR GOD THE JUST IS SATISFIED  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  

---

BEHOLD HIM THERE THE RISEN LAMB  
MY PERFECT SPOTLESS RIGHTEOUSNESS  
THE GREAT UNCHANGEABLE I AM  

---

THE KING OF GLORY AND OF GRACE  
ONE WITH HIMSELF I CANNOT DIE  
MY SOUL IS PURCHASED WITH HIS BLOOD  

---

MY LIFE IS HID WITH CHRIST ON HIGH  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  

---

I BOW BEFORE THE CROSS OF CHRIST  
AND MARVEL AT THIS LOVE DIVINE  
GOD’S PERFECT SON WAS SACRIFICED  

---

TO MAKE ME RIGHTEOUS IN GOD’S EYES  
THE RIVER’S DEPTH I CANNOT KNOW  
BUT I CAN GLORY IN ITS FLOOD  

---

THE LORD MOST HIGH IS BOWED DOWN LOW  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE

#HIS MERCY IS MORE

---

WHAT LOVE COULD REMEMBER  
NO WRONGS WE HAVE DONE  
OMNISCIENT, ALL KNOWING,  

---

HE COUNTS NOT THEIR SUM  
THROWN IN TO A SEA  
WITHOUT BOTTOM OR SHORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

WHAT PATIENCE WOULD WAIT  
AS WE CONSTANTLY ROAM  
WHAT FATHER, SO TENDER,  

---

IS CALLING US HOME  
HE WELCOMES THE WEAKEST,  
THE VILEST, THE POOR  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
WHAT RICHES OF KINDNESS  

---

HE LAVISHED ON US  
HIS BLOOD WAS THE PAYMENT,  
HIS LIFE WAS THE COST  

---

WE STOOD ‘NEATH A DEBT  
WE COULD NEVER AFFORD  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS,  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE
