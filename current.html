#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   


---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   


---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!

*The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples. The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations.*
