#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.

#Your Name

---

As morning dawns and evening fades  
You inspire songs of praise  
That rise from earth to touch  
Your heart and glorify Your Name  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name  

---

Jesus, in Your Name we pray  
Come and fill our hearts today  
Lord, give us strength to live for You  
And glorify Your Name  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  

---

'Cause nothing has the power to save  
nothing has the power to save  
nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name

The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names

Crowned in majesty,  
Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,

Generous and meek,  
Protector of the weak

You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

#The Perfect Wisdom of Our God

---

The perfect wisdom of our God  
Revealed in all the universe;  
All things created by His hand  
And held together at His command.  

---

He knows the mysteries of the seas,  
The secrets of the stars are His;  
He guides the planets on their way  
And turns the earth through another day.  

---

The matchless wisdom of His ways  
That mark the path of righteousness;  
His word a lamp unto my feet,  
His Spirit teaching and guiding me.  

---

And O the mystery of the cross,  
That God should suffer for the lost,  
So that the fool might shame the wise,  
And all the glory might go to Christ!  

---

O grant me wisdom from above,  
To pray for peace and cling to love,  
And teach me humbly to receive  
The sun and rain of Your sovereignty.  

---

Each strand of sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry of grace;  
So through the trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will in Your perfect way.”
