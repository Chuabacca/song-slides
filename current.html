#This is Amazing Grace

---

Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?  
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.  

---

Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder,  
and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for...  
all that You've done for me.

---

Who brings our chaos back into order?  
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?  
The King of Glory, the King of Glory.  

---

Who rules the nations with truth and justice,  
shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.  

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for...  
all that You've done for me.

---

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  

---

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy, worthy, worthy, Oh...

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for...  
all that You've done for me.

---

This is amazing grace,

#The Glories of Calvary

---

*Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more*
  
##*Romans 5:20*

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled  
with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the  
glories of Calvary  

---

With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper  
into the glories of Calvary

---

*so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.*
  
##*Romans 5:21*

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds  
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above  
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb

---

My heart is filled  
with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the  
glories of Calvary  

---

With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  

---

My heart is filled  
with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the  
glories of Calvary  

---

With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper  
into the glories of Calvary  

---

*Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory  *
  
##*1 Peter 1:8*

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled  
with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the  
glories of Calvary  

---

With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper  
into the glories of Calvary

*But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.*
### Isaiah 53:5

# Man of Sorrows

---
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

---

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
Praise and honor unto Thee
