#Who Would Have Dreamed

---

On a starlit hillside,  
shepherds watched their sheep  
Slowly, David’s city  
drifted off to sleep  

---

But to this little  
town of no great renown  
The Lord had a  
promise to keep  

---

Prophets had foretold it,  
a mighty King would come  
Long awaited Ruler,  
God’s Anointed One  

---

But the Sovereign of all  
looked helpless and small  
As God gave the world  
His own Son  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

Wondrous gift of heaven:  
the Father sends the Son  
Planned from time eternal,  
moved by holy love  

---

He will carry our curse  
and death He’ll reverse  
So we can be  
daughters and sons  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world

The glories of His righteousness

Rises in my soul  
Never lets me go

#Go Tell it on the Mountain

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

---

While shepherds kept there watching  
O'er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shown a holy light  
c
---

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

---

The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth  

---

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

---

Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ  

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  

---

That Jesus Christ is born  
That Jesus Christ is born  
That Jesus Christ is born
