      # Cornerstone Fellowship

---

*Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate. So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city,*

---

*but we are seeking the city which is to come. Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.*
### Hebrews 13:11-15

#Our Great God

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God
