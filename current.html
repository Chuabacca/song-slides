#This is Amazing Grace

---

Who breaks the power  
of sin and darkness?  
Whose love is mighty  
and so much stronger?  

---

The King of Glory,  
the King above all kings.  

---

Who shakes the whole earth  
with holy thunder,  
and leaves us breathless  
in awe and wonder?  

---

The King of Glory,  
the King above all kings.

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for  
all that You've done for me.

---

Who brings our chaos  
back into order?  
Who makes the orphan  
a son and daughter?  

---

The King of Glory,  
the King of Glory.  

---

Who rules the nations  
with truth and justice,  
shines like the sun in  
all of its brilliance?  

---

The King of Glory,  
the King above all kings.  

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for  
all that You've done for me.

---

Worthy is the Lamb  
who was slain.  
Worthy is the King  
who conquered the grave.  

---

Worthy is the Lamb  
who was slain.  
Worthy is the King  
who conquered the grave.  

---

Worthy is the Lamb  
who was slain.  
Worthy is the King  
who conquered the grave.  

---

Worthy is the Lamb  
who was slain.  
Worthy, worthy, worthy, Oh...

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for...  
all that You've done for me.

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.

Oh Jesus, I sing for  
all that You've done for me.

*For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;*
## 1 Peter 3:18

#O Praise the Name

---

I cast my mind to Calvary  
Where Jesus bled  
and died for me  

---

I see His wounds,  
His hands, His feet  
My Savior on  
that cursed tree  

---

His body bound and  
drenched in tears  
They laid Him down  
in Joseph's tomb  

---

The entrance sealed  
by heavy stone  
Messiah still  
and all alone  

---

O praise the name  
of the Lord our God  
O praise His name  
forever more  

---

For endless days  
we will sing Your praise  
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  



---

Then on the third  
at break of dawn  
The Son of heaven  
rose again  

---

O trampled death  
where is your sting?  
The angels roar  
for Christ the King  

---

O praise the name  
of the Lord our God  
O praise His name  
forever more  

---

For endless days  
we will sing Your praise  
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  



---

He shall return  
in robes of white  
The blazing Son  
shall pierce the night  

---

And I will rise  
among the saints  
My gaze transfixed  
on Jesus' face  

---

O praise the name  
of the Lord our God  
O praise His name  
forever more  

---

For endless days  
we will sing Your praise  
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  



---

O praise the name  
of the Lord our God  
O praise His name  
forever more  

---

For endless days  
we will sing Your praise  
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  



---

Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

---

When with the ransomed in glory 
His face I at last shall see, 
’Twill be my joy through the ages 
To sing of His love for me. 

---

How marvelous! How wonderful! 
And my song shall ever be: 
How marvelous! How wonderful! 
Is my Savior’s love for me!

#For the Cause

---

For the cause  
of Christ the King  
We give our lives,  
an offering  

---

'Til all the earth  
resounds with  
ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause  
of Christ we go  
With joy to reap,  
with faith to sow  

---

As many see  
And many put their  
trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above  
every name:  

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  

---
  
For the King  
once lifted high  
To cries of rage,  
of 'crucify!'  

---

Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King  
who conquered death  
To free the poor  
and the oppressed  

---

For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  
  
---

Let it be  
my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ,  
to die is gain;  

---

Deny myself,  
take up my cross  
And follow the Son  

---

Let it be  
my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ,  
to die is gain;  

---

Deny myself,  
take up my cross  
And follow the Son  


---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  

---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!
