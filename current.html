*But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.*
###1 Corinthians 5:20-22

#Resurrection Hymn

---

See what a morning,  
gloriously bright  
With the dawning  
Of hope in Jerusalem;  

---

Folded the grave-clothes  
Tomb filled with light,  
As the angels  
Announce Christ is risen  

---

See God's salvation plan,  
wrought in love,  
Borne in pain,  
paid in sacrifice,  

---

Fulfilled in Christ, the Man,  
for He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead  

---

See Mary weeping:  
Where is He laid?  
As in sorrow  
She turns from the empty tomb  

---

Hears a voice speaking,  
calling her name:  
It's the Master,   
The Lord raised to life again!  

---

The voice that spans the years,  
Speaking life,  
stirring hope,  
Bringing peace to us,  

---

Will sound till He appears,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!  

---

One with the Father,  
Ancient of Days,  
Through the Spirit  
Who clothes faith with certainty,  

---

Honor and blessing,  
glory and praise  
To the King crowned  
With power and authority!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead,  
love has won  
Christ has conquered;  

---

And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead,  
love has won  
Christ has conquered;  

---

And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!

#Hallelujah for the Cross

---

Up to the hill  
of Calvary  
My Savior went  
courageously  

---

And there he  
bled and died for me  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

And on that day  
the world was changed  
A final, perfect lamb  
was slain  

---

Let earth and   
heaven now proclaim  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

What good I've done  
could never save  
My debt too great  
for deeds to pay  

---

But God,  
my Savior, made a way  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

A slave to sin,  
my life was bound  
But all my chains  
fell to the ground  

---

When Jesus' blood  
came flowing down  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

*For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.*  
  
##1 Corinthians 1:18

---

And when I breathe  
my final breath  
I'll have no need  
to fear that rest  

---

This hope will  
guide me into death  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah for the cross  
Hallelujah for the cross

#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
