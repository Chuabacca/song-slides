#Resurrection Hymn

---

See what a morning, gloriously bright  
With the dawning  
Of hope in Jerusalem;  

---

Folded the grave-clothes  
Tomb filled with light,  
As the angels  
Announce Christ is risen  

---

See God's salvation plan,  
wrought in love,  
Borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,  
Fulfilled in Christ, the Man, for He lives,  
Christ is risen from the dead  

---

See Mary weeping: 'Where is He laid?  
As in sorrow  
She turns from the empty tomb;  

---

Hears a voice speaking, calling her name:  
It's the Master,   
The Lord raised to life again!  

---

The voice that spans the years,  
Speaking life, stirring hope,  
Bringing peace to us,  
Will sound till He appears,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!  

---

One with the Father, Ancient of Days,  
Through the Spirit  
Who clothes faith with certainty,  

---

Honor and blessing, glory and praise  
To the King crowned  
With power and authority!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead, love has won  
Christ has conquered;  
And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead, love has won  
Christ has conquered;  
And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine
