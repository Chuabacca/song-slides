#Here I Am to Worship

---

Light of the world,  
You stepped down into darkness.  
Opened my eyes, let me see.  

---

Beauty that made  
this heart adore You,  
Hope of a life spent with You  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

King of all days,  
Oh so highly exalted.  
Glorious in Heaven above  

---

Humbly You came  
to the earth You created.  
All for love's sake became poor  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross (3x)  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me

#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!

#You Are God Alone

---

You are not a God created  
by human hands  
You are not a God dependant  
on any mortal man  

---

You are not a God in need of  
anything we can give  
By Your plan  
that’s just the way it is  

---

You are not a God created  
by human hands  
You are not a God dependant  
on any mortal man  

---

You are not a God in need of  
anything we can give  
By Your plan  
that’s just the way it is  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

You’re the only God whose power  
none can contend  
You’re the only God  
whose name and praise will never end  

---

You’re the only God whose worthy of  
everything we can give  
You are God that’s just the way it is  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  
Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  
Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are
