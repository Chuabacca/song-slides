#I Will Glory in My Redeemer

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who crushed the power of sin and death  
My only Savior before the Holy Judge  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
My life He bought, my love He owns  
I have no longings for another.  
I'm satisfied in Him alone

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
His faithfulness my standing place  
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me  
My feet are firm, held by His grace  
My feet are firm, held by His grace.  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who carries me on eagles' wings  
He crowns my life with lovingkindness.  
His triumph song  
I'll ever sing  
...I'll ever sing

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  
...

#In Christ Alone

---

In Christ alone my hope is found,  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,  
Firm through the fiercest
drought and storm

---

What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All,  
Here in the love of Christ I stand

---

In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  

---

'Till on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live

---

There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again

---

And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

---

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand  

---

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand  

---

No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
...

#Revelation Song


and day and night they never cease to say,  
“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,  
who was and is and is to come!”  
(Rev 4:8)

Lamb who was slain  
Holy, holy is He

to Him who sits on  
Heaven's mercy seat

rolls of thunder

#For the Cause

---

For the cause of Christ the King  
We give our lives, an offering  
'Til all the earth resounds   
With ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause of Christ we go  
With joy to reap, with faith to sow  
As many see  
And many put their trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---
  
For the King once lifted high  
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'  
Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King who conquered death  
To free the poor and the oppressed  
For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  
  
---

Let it be my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ, to die is gain;  
Deny myself, take up my cross  
And follow the Son (2x) 


---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!
