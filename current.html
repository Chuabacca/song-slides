## PSALM 1

---

(1) Blessed is the man who walks not
in the council of the wicked,
nor stands in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

---

(2) But his delight is in the law of
the LORD, and on his law he
meditates day and night.

---

(3) He is like a tree planted by
streams of water that yields its
fruit in its season,

---

and its leaf
does not wither. In all that he
does, he prospers.

#His Mercy is More

---

What love could remember  
No wrongs we have done  
Omniscient, all knowing,  

---

He counts not their sum  
Thrown in to a sea  
Without bottom or shore  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

What patience would wait  
As we constantly roam  
What father, so tender,  

---

Is calling us home  
He welcomes the weakest,  
The vilest, the poor  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord  

---

His mercy is more  
Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
What riches of kindness  

---

He lavished on us  
His blood was the payment,  
His life was the cost  

---

We stood ‘neath a debt  
We could never afford  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness,  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more

#Never Once

---

Standing on this mountain top  
Looking just how far we’ve come  
Knowing that for every step  
You were with us  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Never once did we ever walk alone  

---

Carried by your constant grace  
Held within your perfect peace  
Never once, no we never walk alone  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Every step we are breathing in your grace  
Evermore we’ll be  
Breathing out your praise  

---

You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful!

#Consider Love

---

And let us consider how we may  
Spur one another on,  
toward love and good deeds

---

Let us not give up,  
the meeting together  
as some are in the habit of doing  

---

But let us encourage one another  
All the more  
As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching  

---

And let us consider how we may  
Spur one another on,  
toward love and good deeds

---

Let us not give up,  
the meeting together  
as some are in the habit of doing  

---

But let us encourage one another  
All the more  
As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching  

---

And let us (and let us)  
consider how to love 4x

---

As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching    
...
