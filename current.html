#God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

---

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
let nothing you dismay  
Remember, Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas Day  

---

To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

In Bethlehem, in Israel,  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
upon this blessed morn  

---

The which His Mother Mary  
did nothing take in scorn  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

From God our heav'nly Father,  
a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tiding of the same  

---

How that in Bethlehem was born  
the Son of God by name  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy

#Who Would Have Dreamed

---

On a starlit hillside,  
shepherds watched their sheep  
Slowly, David’s city  
drifted off to sleep  

---

But to this little  
town of no great renown  
The Lord had a  
promise to keep  

---

Prophets had foretold it,  
a mighty King would come  
Long awaited Ruler,  
God’s Anointed One  

---

But the Sovereign of all  
looked helpless and small  
As God gave the world  
His own Son  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

Wondrous gift of heaven:  
the Father sends the Son  
Planned from time eternal,  
moved by holy love  

---

He will carry our curse  
and death He’ll reverse  
So we can be  
daughters and sons  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

To save the world

#Hark the Herald Angels Sing

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King    
Peace on earth and mercy mild,   
God and sinners reconciled"   

---

Joyful all ye nations rise,   
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim,   
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"  

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"  

---
  
Christ, by highest heaven adored;   
Christ the everlasting Lord;   
Late in time behold him come,   
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.   

---

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;   
hail the incarnate Deity   
Pleased as man with men to dwell,   
Jesus, our Immanuel   

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"  

---
  
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace.   
Hail the son of Righteousness   
Light and life to all He brings,   
risen with healing in His wings  

---

Mild He lays His glory by,   
born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth,   
born to give them second birth  

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"
