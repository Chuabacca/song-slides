#Angels We Have Heard On High

---

Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Shepherds why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heav'nly song  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn King  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

See within a manger laid  
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth  
Mary Joseph lend your aid  
With us sing our Savior's birth  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo

#Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus

---

Come Thou long-expected Jesus  
Born to set Thy people free  
From our fears and sins release us  
Let us find our rest in Thee  

---

Israel's strength and consolation  
Hope of all the earth Thou art  
Dear desire of every nation  
Joy of every longing heart  

---

Joy to those who long to see thee  
Dayspring from on high, appear;  
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse  
of Thy birth we long to hear!  

---

O’er the hills the angels singing   
News, glad tidings of a birth  
“Go to him, your praises bringing;   
Christ the Lord has come to Earth.”  

---

Come to earth to taste our sadness,   
He whose glories knew no end;  
by His life He brings us gladness  
Our redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.   

---

Leaving riches without number,   
born within a cattle stall;  
This the everlasting wonder  
Christ was born the Lord of all!  

---

Born Thy people to deliver  
Born a child and yet a King  
Born to reign in us forever  
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring  

---

By Thine own eternal Spirit  
Rule in all our hearts alone    
By Thine all-sufficient merit  
Raise us to Thy glorious throne  
...

O come, o come Emmanuel  
And ransom captive Israel  
That mourns in lowly exile here  
Until the Son of God appear  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel

Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height  
In ancient times didst give the law,  
In cloud, and majesty, and awe.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  

---

O come Thou Rod of Jesse, free  
Thine own from Satan's tyranny  
From depths of hell Thy people save  
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
O come Thou Dayspring come and cheer  

---

Our spirits by Thine advent here  
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night  
And death's dark shadows put to flight.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
...
