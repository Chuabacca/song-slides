#Jesus Messiah

---

He became sin who knew no sin.  
That we might become His righteousness  
He humbled himself and carried the cross.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing  

---

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

---

His body the bread, His blood the wine.  
Broken and poured out all for love.  
The whole earth trembled and the veil was torn.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing!

---

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

All our hope is in You.  
All our hope is in You.  
All the glory to You, God  
The light of the world

#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.

#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.
