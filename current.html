#Before The Throne Of God Above

---

Before the throne of God above  
I have a strong and perfect plea  
A great high priest whose name is love  

---

Who ever lives and pleads for me  
My name is graven on his hands  
My name is written on his heart  

---

I know that while in heav’n he stands  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  

---

When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see him there  

---

Who made an end of all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  

---

For God the just is satisfied  
To look on him and pardon me  
To look on him and pardon me  

---

Behold him there the risen Lamb  
My perfect spotless righteousness  
The great unchangeable I AM  

---

The King of glory and of grace  
One with himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased with his blood  

---

My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God  
With Christ my Savior and my God  

---

I bow before the cross of Christ  
And marvel at this love divine  
God’s perfect on was sacrificed  

---

To make me righteous in God’s eyes  
The river’s depth I cannot know  
But I can glory in its flood  

---

The Lord most high is bowed down low  
And poured on me his glorious love  
And poured on me his glorious love  
And poured on me his glorious love

#Never Once

---

Standing on this mountain top  
Looking just how far we’ve come  
Knowing that for every step  
You were with us  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Never once did we ever walk alone  

---

Carried by your constant grace  
Held within your perfect peace  
Never once, no we never walk alone  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Every step we are breathing in your grace  
Evermore we’ll be  
Breathing out your praise  

---

You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful!

The splendor of a King,

Let all the Earth rejoice

And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice

How great is our God,  
and all will see

---

How great,  
how great is our God


---

Age to age He stands  
And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end

---

The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb

---

How great is our God,  
sing with me  
How great is our God,  
and all will see

---

How great,  
how great is our God

Name above all names  
Worthy of our praise  
My heart will sing  
How great is our God

You're the name above all names  
You are worthy of our praise  
And my heart will sing  
How great is our God

How great is our God,  
and all will see

How great is our God,  
and all will see
