#Hallelujah for the Cross

---

Up to the hill  
of Calvary  
My Savior went  
courageously  

---

And there he  
bled and died for me  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

And on that day  
the world was changed  
A final, perfect lamb  
was slain  

---

Let earth and   
heaven now proclaim  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

What good I've done  
could never save  
My debt too great  
for deeds to pay  

---

But God,  
my Savior, made a way  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

A slave to sin,  
my life was bound  
But all my chains  
fell to the ground  

---

When Jesus' blood  
came flowing down  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

And when I breathe  
my final breath  
I'll have no need  
to fear that rest  

---

This hope will  
guide me into death  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah for the cross  
Hallelujah for the cross

#Now Why This Fear?

---

Now why this fear and unbelief  
Has not the Father put to grief  
His spotless Son for us  

---

And will the righteous Judge of men  
Condemn me for that debt of sin  
now canceled at the cross  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

Complete atonement You have made  
And by Your death have fully paid  
The debt Your people owed  

---

No wrath remains for us to face  
We're sheltered by Your saving grace  
And sprinkled with Your blood  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

Be still my soul and know this peace  
The merits of your great high priest  
Have bought your liberty  

---

Rely then on His precious blood  
Don't fear your banishment from God  
Since Jesus sets you free  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love
