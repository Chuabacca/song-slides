#There is a Redeemer

---

There is a Redeemer  
Jesus God’s own Son  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Holy one  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done  

---

Jesus my Redeemer  
Name above all names  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Oh for sinners slain  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done  

---

When I stand in glory  
I will see his face  
There i’ll serve my king forever  
In that holy place  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done

#His Mercy is More

---

What love could remember  
No wrongs we have done  
Omniscient, all knowing,  

---

He counts not their sum  
Thrown in to a sea  
Without bottom or shore  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

What patience would wait  
As we constantly roam  
What father, so tender,  

---

Is calling us home  
He welcomes the weakest,  
The vilest, the poor  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord  

---

His mercy is more  
Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
What riches of kindness  

---

He lavished on us  
His blood was the payment,  
His life was the cost  

---

We stood ‘neath a debt  
We could never afford  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness,  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more

# Come Thou Fount, Come Thou King

---

Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing  
Tune My Heart To Sing Thy Grace  
Streams Of Mercy Never Ceasing  
Call For songs Of Loudest Praise  

---

Teach Me Some Melodious Sonnet  
Sung By Flaming Tongues Above  
Praise The Mount I'm Fixed Upon it  
Mount of Thy Redeeming Love  

---

I Was Lost In Utter Darkness  
Till You Came And Rescued Me  
I Was Bound By All My Sin When  
Your Love Came And Rescued Me  

---

Now My Soul Can Sing A New Song  
Now My Heart Has Found A Home  
Now Your Grace Is Always With Me  
And I'll Never Be alone  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

O To Grace How Great A Debtor  
Daily I'm Constrained To Be  
Let Thy Goodness Like a Fetter  
Bind My Wandering Heart To Thee  

---

Prone To Wander Lord I Feel It  
Prone To Leave The God I Love  
Here's My Heart Lord Take And Seal It  
Seal It For Thy Courts Above  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

I Was Lost In Utter Darkness  
‘Til You Came And Rescued Me  
I Was Bound By All My Sin When  
Your Love Came And Set Me Free  

---

Now My Soul Can Sing A New Song  
Now My Heart Has Found A Home  
Now Your Grace Is Always with Me  
And I'll Never Be Alone
