      # Cornerstone Fellowship

*O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!*

---

*From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.*

---

*When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;*

---

*What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty!*

---

*You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field, The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,*

---

*Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth!*
##Psalm 8

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.     

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross
