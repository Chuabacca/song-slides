#Word of God

---

The Word of God is  
light in my darkness  
Hope for the hopeless,  
strong and true  

---

The Word of God is  
strength for the weary  
a shield for those who  
trust in You  
a shield for those who  
trust in You  

---

Everything will fade,  
everything will fade  
The heavens and the  
earth will pass away  

---

But You will remain,  
yes You will remain  
always  

---

Jesus, faithful  
Word of God  
The anchor of my heart  
You're everything You  
say You are (Lord)  

---

Greater than my deepest needs  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your promises won't  
fail me now

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.     

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross

Wonderful, Merciful Savior  
Precious Redeemer and Friend  
Who would have thought that a lamb could  
Rescue the souls of men  
Oh, You Rescue the souls of men

Hopelessly lost our way  
Oh, we've hopelessly lost our way

Faithfully loving Your own  
Here in our weakness You find us  
Falling before Your throne
