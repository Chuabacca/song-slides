#Welcome to Cornerstone
##We'll be starting soon

#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
...

Are you empty  
Come and drink these living waters  
Tired and broken  
Peace unspoken  
Rest beside these living waters

Find refreshing  
At the cross of living waters  
Lay your life down  
All the old gone  
Rise up in these living waters

With mercy and love  
Bringing joy to the city of our God  
There our hope is secure  
Do not fear anymore  
Praise the Lord of living waters

Mercy washing  
Healing in these living waters  
Lead your children  
To the shore line  
Life is in these living waters
