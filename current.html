# PSALM 1

---

*(1) Blessed is the man who walks not  
in the council of the wicked,  
nor stands in the way of sinners,  
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;*  

---

*(2) But his delight is in the law of    
the LORD, and on his law he    
meditates day and night.*

#Joy To The World

---

Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  

---

And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and heav'n and  na - ture sing  

---

Joy to the earth the Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks hills and plains  

---

Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat repeat the sounding joy  

---

No more let sins and sorrows grow  
Nor thorns infest the ground  
He comes to make His blessings flow  

---

Far as the curse is found  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as far as the curse is found  

---

He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  

---

And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders and wonders of His love

#Who Would Have Dreamed

---

On a starlit hillside,  
shepherds watched their sheep  
Slowly, David’s city  
drifted off to sleep  

---

But to this little  
town of no great renown  
The Lord had a  
promise to keep  

---

Prophets had foretold it,  
a mighty King would come  
Long awaited Ruler,  
God’s Anointed One  

---

But the Sovereign of all  
looked helpless and small  
As God gave the world  
His own Son  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

Wondrous gift of heaven:  
the Father sends the Son  
Planned from time eternal,  
moved by holy love  

---

He will carry our curse  
and death He’ll reverse  
So we can be  
daughters and sons  

---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

And who would have  
dreamed or ever foreseen  
That we could hold  
God in our hands?  

---

The Giver of Life  
is born in the night  
Revealing God’s  
glorious plan  
To save the world  


---

To save the world
