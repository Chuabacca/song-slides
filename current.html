#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.
