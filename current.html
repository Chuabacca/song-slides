#The Heart of Worship

---

WHEN THE MUSIC FADES,  
ALL IS STRIPPED AWAY,  
AND I SIMPLY COME  

---

LONGING JUST TO BRING,  
SOMETHING THAT’S OF WORTH  
THAT WILL BLESS YOUR HEART  

---

I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG,  
FOR A SONG IN ITSELF  
IS NOT WHAT YOU HAVE REQUIRED  

---

YOU SEARCH MUCH DEEPER WITHIN,  
THROUGH THE WAY THINGS APPEAR,  
YOU’RE LOOKING INTO MY HEART  

---

I’M COMING BACK TO THE   
HEART OF WORSHIP  
AND IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’M SORRY LORD FOR THE   
THING I’VE MADE IT  
WHEN IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

KING OF ENDLESS WORTH,  
NO ONE COULD EXPRESS  
HOW MUCH YOU DESERVE  

---
 
THOUGH I’M WEAK AND POOR,    
ALL I HAVE IS YOURS    
EVER SINGLE BREATH    
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG,    
FOR A SONG IN ITSELF    

---

IS NOT WHAT YOU HAVE REQUIRED    
YOU SEARCH MUCH DEEPER WITHIN,    
THROUGH THE WAY THINGS APPEAR    
YOU’RE LOOKING INTO MY HEART    

---

I’M COMING BACK TO THE  
HEART OF WORSHIP  
AND IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’M SORRY LORD FOR THE  
THING I’VE MADE IT  
WHEN IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
  
---
  
YOUR LOOKING INTO MY HEART,  
INTO MY HEART  
YOUR LOOKING INTO MY HEART  
INTO MY HEART  
  
---
  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG

#Prepare Our Hearts Oh Lord

---

PREPARE OUR HEARTS, OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

YOU PAID THE PRICE OF SIN,  
THROUGH YOUR BLOOD WE BEGIN  
TO SEE YOUR TRUTH,  
YOU’VE PAID THE PRICE  

---

OH DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING?  
GRAVE WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY?  
BUT THANKS BE TO GOD,  
THROUGH YOU OH LORD  

---

PREPARE OUR HEARTS, OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

EVERY KNEE WILL BOW,   
CHRIST IS LORD!  
EVERY TONGUE CONFESS CHRIST IS LORD!  

---

YOU CALL OUR NAME OH LORD,  
YOU CALL OUR NAME SO CLEARLY  
THAT WE MIGHT BE PREPARED TO SEE YOUR FACE  

---

YOU OPEN OUR EYES AND EARS,  
O KNOW YOUR WORD SO CLEAR  
THAT WE MIGHT KNOW HOW NEAR,  
YOU REALLY ARE  

---
  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW,  
CHRIST IS LORD!  
EVERY TONGUE CONFESS CHRIST IS LORD!  

---

CHRIST IS LORD!  
CHRIST IS LORD!   
CHRIST IS LORD!
