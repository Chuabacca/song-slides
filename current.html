# Blessed Be Your Name

Blessed be Your name  
In the land that is plentiful  
When the streams of abundance flow  
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name  
When I'm found in the desert place  
Though I walk through the wilderness  
Blessed be Your name

Every blessing you pour out  
I'll turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in Lord  
Still I will say

Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name

Blessed be Your name  
When the sun's shining down on me  
When the world's all as it should be  
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name  
On the road marked with suffering  
Though there's pain in the offering  
Blessed be Your name

Every blessing you pour out  
I'll turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in Lord  
Still I will say

You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord blessed be Your name

#You Are God Alone

---

You are not a God created  
by human hands  
You are not a God dependant  
on any mortal man  

---

You are not a God in need of  
anything we can give  
By Your plan  
that’s just the way it is  

---

that’s just the way it is  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone

You’re the only God whose power  
none can contend  
You’re the only God  
whose name and praise will never end

You’re the only God whose worthy of  
everything we can give  
You are God that’s just the way it is

Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  
Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone

*Bless the LORD, O my soul,  
Bless the LORD, O my soul,  
And forget none of His benefits;*

---

*Who pardons all your iniquities,  
Who heals all your diseases;  
Who redeems your life from the pit,  
Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion;*

#I Will Glory in My Redeemer

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who crushed the power of sin and death  
My only Savior before the Holy Judge  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
My life He bought, my love He owns  
I have no longings for another.  
I'm satisfied in Him alone

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
His faithfulness my standing place  
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me  
My feet are firm, held by His grace  
My feet are firm, held by His grace.  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who carries me on eagles' wings  
He crowns my life with lovingkindness.  
His triumph song  
I'll ever sing  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree
