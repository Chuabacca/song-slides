#This is Amazing Grace

---

Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?  
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.  
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder,  
and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.

---

This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love,
that You would take my place, that You would bear my cross.  
You laid down Your life, that I would be set free
Oh Jesus, I sing for... all that You've done for me.

---

Who brings our chaos back into order?
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?  
The King of Glory, the King of Glory.
Who rules the nations with truth and justice,  
shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?
The King of Glory, the King above all kings. 

---

This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love,
that You would take my place, that You would bear my cross.  
You laid down Your life, that I would be set free
Oh Jesus, I sing for... all that You've done for me.

--

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Worthy, worthy, worthy, Oh...

---

This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love,
that You would take my place, that You would bear my cross.  
You laid down Your life, that I would be set free
Oh Jesus, I sing for... all that You've done for me.

This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love,
that You would take my place, that You would bear my cross.

#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure, A promise so secure  
The mystery of God At last made known  
Treasures so vast appear, All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us the hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so true. A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice  
And when that life was nailed, On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with him was crucified  

---

There is a life so strong, That a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of hell Could not defeat
For Jesus rose again And if we died with him
With him weâ€™ll rise To share his endless life

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory

#The Glories of Calvary

And the law came in beside, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly  
Romans 5:20

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

so also grace might reign through righteousness, to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans 5:21

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible  
1 Peter 1:8

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy
Our God has set us free
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree

My life He bought, my love He owns  
I have no longings for another.  
I'm satisfied in Him alone

Though foes are mighty and rush upon me

Who carries me on eagles' wings  
He crowns my life with lovingkindness.

Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold
