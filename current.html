Bless the Lord, O my soul.
O my soul
Worship His holy name

Sing like never before.
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up,
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing
Your song again

Whatever may pass,
And what ever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes

Bless the Lord, O my soul.
O my soul
Worship His holy name

Sing like never before.
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

You're rich in love,
And you're slow to anger
Your name is great,
And Your heart is kind

For all of Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.
O my soul
Worship His holy name

Sing like never before.
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come

---

Still my soul will sing
Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forever more

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.
O my soul
Worship His holy name

I'll worship Your holy name

#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;
Hear the call of Christ our captain.
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given.

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,
Reaching out to those in darkness.

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
But to rage against the captor;
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,
We will fight with faith and valor.

---

When faced with trials on every side,
We know the outcome is secure.
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:
An inheritance of nations.

---
      
Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
As the Son of God is stricken;
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
For the Conqueror has risen!

---

And as the stone is rolled away,
And Christ emerges from the grave,
This victory march continues till the day
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;
Give grace for every hurdle.
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful.

---

As saints of old, still line the way,
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
When with Christ we stand in Glory.

---
      
Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!

---

Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!
