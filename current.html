## PSALM 1

---

(1) Blessed is the man who walks not
in the council of the wicked,
nor stands in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

---

(2) But his delight is in the law of
the LORD, and on his law he
meditates day and night.

---

(3) He is like a tree planted by
streams of water that yields its
fruit in its season,

---

and its leaf
does not wither. In all that he
does, he prospers.

#Behold Our God

---

Who has held the oceans in His hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at His voice  
All creation rises to rejoice  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of His words?  
Who can teach the One who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has felt the nails upon His hands?  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man  
God eternal, humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

You will reign forever 4x  
(Let Your glory fill the earth) 4x

#Come Behold The Wondrous Mystery

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
In the dawning of the King  
He the theme of heaven’s praises  
Robed in frail humanity  

---

In our longing, in our darkness  
Now the light of life has come  
Look to Christ, who condescended  
Took on flesh to ransom us  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
He the perfect Son of Man  
In His living, in His suffering  
Never trace nor stain of sin  

---

See the true and better Adam  
Come to save the hell-bound man  
Christ the great and sure fulfillment  
Of the law; in Him we stand  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Christ the Lord upon the tree  
In the stead of ruined sinners  
Hangs the Lamb in victory  

---

See the price of our redemption  
See the Father’s plan unfold  
Bringing many sons to glory  
Grace unmeasured, love untold  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Slain by death the God of life  
But no grave could e’er restrain Him  
Praise the Lord; He is alive!  

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected  
As we will be when he comes  

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected  
As we will be when he comes
