#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.

#Be Thou My Vision

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

O God be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory my soul satisfied  
O God be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory my soul satisfied  

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

O God be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory my soul satisfied  
O God be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory my soul satisfied  

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground

His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun

Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation

But I will rise,   
He will call me home
