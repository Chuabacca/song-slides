#In Christ Alone

---

In Christ alone my hope is found,  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,  
Firm through the fiercest
drought and storm

---

What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All,  
Here in the love of Christ I stand

---

In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  

---

'Till on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live

---

There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again

---

And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

---

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand  

---

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand  

---

No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
...

# Man of Sorrows

---
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

---

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
...
