# 10,000 Reasons

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
O my soul  
Worship His holy name  

---

Sing like never before.
O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

---

The sun comes up,  
It's a new day dawning  
It's time to sing  
Your song again  

---

Whatever may pass,  
And what ever lies before me  
Let me be singing  
When the evening comes  

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
O my soul  
Worship His holy name  

---

Sing like never before.  
O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

---

You're rich in love,  
And you're slow to anger  
Your name is great,  
And Your heart is kind  

---

For all of Your goodness  
I will keep on singing  
Ten thousand reasons  
For my heart to find  

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
O my soul  
Worship His holy name  

---

Sing like never before.  
O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

---

And on that day  
When my strength is failing  
The end draws near  
And my time has come  

---

Still my soul will sing  
Your praise unending  
Ten thousand years  
And then forever more  

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
O my soul  
Worship His holy name  

---

Sing like never before. 
O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

---

Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
O my soul  
Worship His holy name  

---

Sing like never before.  
O my soul  

---

I'll worship Your holy name  
I'll worship Your holy name  
I'll worship Your holy name

#Christ The Sure And Steady Anchor

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
In the fury of the storm  
When the winds of doubt blow through me  
And my sails have all been torn

---

In the suffering, and the sorrow  
When my sinking hopes are few  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
while the tempest rages on  
When temptation claims the battle  
And it seems the night has won

---

Deeper still then goes the anchor  
Though I justly stand accused  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
through the floods of unbelief  
Hopeless, somehow, O my soul now  
Lift your eyes to Calvary

---

This my ballast of assurance  
See His love forever proved  
All my hope is in the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
As we face the wave of death  
When these trials give way to glory  
As we draw our final breath

---

We will cross that great horizon  
Clouds behind and life secure:  
And the calm will be the better  
For the storms that we endure

---

Christ the shore of our salvation,  
Ever faithful, Ever true!  
We will hold fast to the anchor,  
It shall never be removed
