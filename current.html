#Christ The Sure And Steady Anchor

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
In the fury of the storm  
When the winds of doubt blow through me  
And my sails have all been torn

---

In the suffering, and the sorrow  
When my sinking hopes are few  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
while the tempest rages on  
When temptation claims the battle  
And it seems the night has won

---

Deeper still then goes the anchor  
Though I justly stand accused  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
through the floods of unbelief  
Hopeless, somehow, O my soul now  
Lift your eyes to Calvary

---

This my ballast of assurance  
See His love forever proved  
All my hope is in the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
As we face the wave of death  
When these trials give way to glory  
As we draw our final breath

---

We will cross that great horizon  
Clouds behind and life secure:  
And the calm will be the better  
For the storms that we endure

---

Christ the shore of our salvation,  
Ever faithful, Ever true!  
We will hold fast to the anchor,  
It shall never be removed

#Behold Our God

---

Who has held the oceans in His hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at His voice  
All creation rises to rejoice  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of His words?  
Who can teach the One who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has felt the nails upon His hands?  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man  
God eternal, humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

You will reign forever 4x  
(Let Your glory fill the earth) 4x

#Yet Not I, But Through Christ in Me

---

What gift of grace, is Jesus my Redeemer  
There is no more, for heaven now to give  
He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom  
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
For my life is wholly bound to His  
Oh how strange and divine,  
I can sing all is mine!

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.  
For by my side, the Savior He will stay  
I labor on, in weakness and rejoicing  
For in my need His power is displayed.

---

To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me  
Through the deepest valley He will lead  
Oh the night has been won,  
and I shall overcome!

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.  
The future sure, the price it has been paid.  
For Jesus bled, and suffered for my pardon  
And He was raised to overcome the grave.

---

To this I hold, my sin has been defeated  
Jesus now and evermore my plea  
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am  
Free! Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

With every breath, I long to follow Jesus.  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day, I know He will renew me  
Until I stand, with joy before the throne

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.  
All the glory evermore to Him.  
When the race is complete, still my lips  
shall repeat

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him.  
When the race is complete,  
still my lips shall repeat

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

When the race is complete,  
still my lips shall repeat:  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!
