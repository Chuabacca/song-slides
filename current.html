      # Cornerstone Fellowship

---

*Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely.*

---

*and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith,*

---

*who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.*
### Hebrews 12:1–2

#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   


---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   


---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!

#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.

#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure,  
A promise so secure  
The mystery of God  
At last made known  

---

Treasures so vast appear,  
All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us  
The hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  

---

And each day I live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  


---

There is a life so true.  
A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a  
Perfect sacrifice  

---

And when that life was nailed,  
On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with  
Him was crucified  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  

---

And each day I live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  


---

There is a life so strong,  
That a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of  
Hell could not defeat  

---

For Jesus rose again  
And if we died with him  
With him we’ll rise  
To share his endless life  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  

---

And each day I live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  


---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  

---

And each day I live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  


---

Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory
