#Be Thou My Vision

---

*But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss  
for the sake of Christ.*  


---

Be Thou my Vision,  
O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me,  
save that Thou art.  

---

Thou my best Thought,  
by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping,  
Thy presence my light.  

---

*Indeed, I count everything as loss  
because of the surpassing worth of  
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.* 

---

Be Thou my Wisdom,  
and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and  
Thou with me, Lord;  

---

Thou my great Father,  
I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling,  
and I with Thee one.  

---

*For his sake I have suffered the loss of  
all things and count them as rubbish,  
in order that I may gain Christ*

---

Riches I heed not,  
nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance,  
now and always  

---

Thou and Thou only,  
put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven,  
my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything,  
be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory  
My soul's satisfied  

---

Oh, God, be my everything,  
be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory  
My soul's satisfied  

---

*Not having a righteousness of my own  
that comes from the law,  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God that depends on faith*

---

High King of Heaven,  
my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys,  
bright Heaven's Sun!  

---

Heart of my own heart,  
whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision,  
O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything,  
be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory  
My soul's satisfied  

---

Oh, God, be my everything,  
be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory  
My soul's satisfied  

---

Thou my best Thought,  
by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping,  
Thy presence my light.
