#No Other Savior

---

Lord of every age, Author of our faith  
The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names  

---

Crowned in majesty,  
Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,  
The world at his command.  
The world at his command  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

Merciful High priest,  
Lover of the least  
Generous and meek,  
Protector of the weak

---

Sacrificed to death, For us,  
Your final breath  
You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  

---

You will reign forever  
You reign fore - ver  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.     

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross

#Word of God

---

The Word of God is  
light in my darkness  
Hope for the hopeless,  
strong and true  

---

The Word of God is  
strength for the weary  
a shield for those who trust in You  
a shield for those who trust in You  

---

Everything will fade,  
everything will fade  
The heavens and the  
earth will pass away  

---

But You will remain,  
yes You will remain  
always  

---

Jesus, faithful Word of God  
The anchor of my heart  
You're everything You  
say You are (Lord)  

---

Greater than my deepest needs  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your promises won't  
fail me now  

---
