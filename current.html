But thanks be to God, 
that you who were once 
slaves of sin have 
become obedient from
the heart to the standard 
of teaching to which you 
were committed, and, 
having been set free 
from sin, have become 
slaves of righteousness.*
## Romans 6:17-18

# Man of Sorrows

---
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

---

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
Praise and honor unto Thee

*
Jesus answered them, â€œTruly, truly, 
I say to you, everyone who 
practices sin is a slave to sin. 
The slave does not remain in 
the house forever; the son 
remains forever. So if the Son 
sets you free, you will be free 
indeed.*
## John 8:34-36

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how  
sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch  
like me!  

---

I once was lost,  
but now am found  
Was blind but  
now I see  

---

T'was grace that  
taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears  
relieved;  

---

How precious did  
that grace appear  
The hour I first  
believed  

---

My chains are gone,  
I've been set free  
my God my Savior  
has ransomed me  

---

and like a flood  
His mercy rains  
Unending love  
Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised  
good to me  
His word my hope  
secures  

---

He will my shield  
and portion be  
as long as life  
endures  

---

My chains are gone,  
I've been set free  
my God my Savior  
has ransomed me  

---

and like a flood  
His mercy rains  
Unending love  
Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone,  
I've been set free  
my God my Savior  
has ransomed me  

---

and like a flood  
His mercy rains  
Unending love  
Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon  
dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear  
to shine;  

---

But God, who call'd  
me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God  
unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  

---

Your boundless love  
unfailing  
in grace and  
mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in  
endless flight  
around your  
glorious throne  

---

They raise their voices  
day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak  
and frail  
helpless in  
the storm  

---

Surround us with  
Your angels  
hold us in  
Your arms  

---

Our cold and  
ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is  
our harm  

---

Rise up oh Lord  
and he will flee  
before our  
Sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature  
in the sea  
and every flying bird  

---

Let every mountain  
every field  
and valley of  
the earth  

---

Let all the moons  
and all the stars  
in all the universe  

---

Sing praises to  
the living God  
who rules them  
by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God
