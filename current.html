# PSALM 1

---

*(1) Blessed is the man who walks not  
in the council of the wicked,  
nor stands in the way of sinners,  
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;*  

---

*(2) But his delight is in the law of    
the LORD, and on his law he    
meditates day and night.*    

---

*(3) He is like a tree planted by  
streams of water that yields its  
fruit in its season,*  

---

*and its leaf  
does not wither. In all that he    
does, he prospers.*    
  
---

*(4) The wicked are not so, but are  
like chaff that the wind drives  
away.*  
  
---

*(5) Therefore the wicked will not  
stand in the judgement, nor  
sinners in the congregation of  
the righteous;*  
  
---

*for the LORD knows the way of  
the righteous, but the way of the    
wicked will perish.*

# Man of Sorrows

---
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

---

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love  
poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
Praise and honor unto Thee
