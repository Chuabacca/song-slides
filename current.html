#Hark the Herald Angels Sing

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King    
Peace on earth and mercy mild,   
God and sinners reconciledâ€œ   

---

Joyful all ye nations rise,   
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim,   
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"  

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored;   
Christ the everlasting Lord;   
Late in time behold him come,   
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;   
hail the incarnate Deity   
Pleased as man with men to dwell,   
Jesus, our Immanuel

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace.   
Hail the son of Righteousness   
Light and life to all He brings,   
risen with healing in His wings  

---

Mild He lays His glory by,   
born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth,   
born to give them second birth  

---

#Jesus Joy of the Highest Heaven

---

Jesus, joy of the highest heaven,  
Born as a little baby  
Under a wondrous star.  

---

Like us, crying He takes His first breath  
Held by His mother, helpless  
Close to her beating heart.  

---

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,  
Facing a world of dangers,  
Come to turn me a stranger  
Into a child of God.  

---

Close to her beating heart.  

---

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,  
Facing a world of dangers,  
Come to turn me a stranger  
Into a child of God.  

---

Jesus, King of the highest heaven  
Learning to take His first steps,  
That He might bring us life.  

---

Like us, knowing our smiles and sorrows,  
He showed the way to follow,  
A way that is true and right.  

---

Jesus, take away every darkness,  
Steady my simple footsteps  
That I might in your goodness  
Live as a child of God.

#It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

---

It came upon the midnight clear,   
That glorious song of old.   
From angels bending near the earth,   
To touch their harps of gold;  

---

Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,   
From heaven's all gracious King!   
The world in solemn stillness lay,   
To hear the angels sing.  

---

He came down from His heav'nly throne   
into a world of death   
And with His perfect sacrifice   
the sinner now is blest  

---

Though as a Child in manger lay   
He still is Christ the King   
"All glory be to God on high!"   
The saints and angels sing  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,   
Whose forms are bending low,   
Who toil along the climbing way   
With painful steps and slow,  

---

Look now, for glad and golden hours   
Come swiftly on the wing   
And rest beside the weary road   
And hear the angels sing.  

---

For lo, the days are hastening on,   
By prophets seen of old  
When with the ever circling years   
Shall come the time foretold  

---

When peace shall over   
all the earth Its ancient splendors fling,  
And the whole world send back the song  
Which now the angels sing.  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

Though as a Child in manger lay   
He still is Christ the King   
"All glory be to God on high!"   
The saints and angels sing  
...

#God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
let nothing you dismay  
Remember, Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas Day  

---

To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

In Bethlehem, in Israel,  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
upon this blessed morn

The which His Mother Mary  
did nothing take in scorn  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

From God our heav'nly Father,  
a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tiding of the same

the Son of God by name  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy

O, tidings of comfort and joy
