## PSALM 1

---

(1) Blessed is the man who walks not
in the council of the wicked,
nor stands in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

---

(2) But his delight is in the law of
the LORD, and on his law he
meditates day and night.

---

(3) He is like a tree planted by
streams of water that yields its
fruit in its season,

---

and its leaf
does not wither. In all that he
does, he prospers.

---

(4) The wicked are not so, but are
like chaff that the wind drives
away.

---

(5) Therefore the wicked will not
stand in the judgement, nor
sinners in the congregation of
the righteous;

---

(6) 
for the LORD knows the way of
the righteous, but the way of the
wicked will perish.

#Consider Love

---

And let us consider how we may  
Spur one another on,  
toward love and good deeds

---

Let us not give up,  
the meeting together  
as some are in the habit of doing  

---

But let us encourage one another  
All the more  
As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching  

---

And let us consider how we may  
Spur one another on,  
toward love and good deeds

---

Let us not give up,  
the meeting together  
as some are in the habit of doing  

---

But let us encourage one another  
All the more  
As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching  

---

And let us (and let us)  
consider how to love 4x

---

As you see the day  
As you see the day  
As you see the day, approaching    
...

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God  
unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  

---

Your boundless love  
unfailing  
in grace and  
mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in  
endless flight  
around your  
glorious throne  

---

They raise their voices  
day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak  
and frail  
helpless in  
the storm  

---

Surround us with  
Your angels  
hold us in  
Your arms  

---

Our cold and  
ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is  
our harm  

---

Rise up oh Lord  
and he will flee  
before our  
Sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature  
in the sea  
and every flying bird  

---

Let every mountain  
every field  
and valley of  
the earth  

---

Let all the moons  
and all the stars  
in all the universe  

---

Sing praises to  
the living God  
who rules them  
by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God

#Christ The Sure And Steady Anchor

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
In the fury of the storm  
When the winds of doubt blow through me  
And my sails have all been torn

---

In the suffering, and the sorrow  
When my sinking hopes are few  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
while the tempest rages on  
When temptation claims the battle  
And it seems the night has won

---

Deeper still then goes the anchor  
Though I justly stand accused  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
through the floods of unbelief  
Hopeless, somehow, O my soul now  
Lift your eyes to Calvary

---

This my ballast of assurance  
See His love forever proved  
All my hope is in the anchor  
It shall never be removed

---

Christ the sure and steady anchor  
As we face the wave of death  
When these trials give way to glory  
As we draw our final breath

---

We will cross that great horizon  
Clouds behind and life secure:  
And the calm will be the better  
For the storms that we endure

---

Christ the shore of our salvation,  
Ever faithful, Ever true!  
We will hold fast to the anchor,  
It shall never be removed
