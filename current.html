#Grace and Peace

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
For lawbreakers and thieves  
For the worthless, the least  

---

You have said,  
that our judgment is death  
For all eternity  
Without hope,  
without rest  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
The matchless King of all  
Paid the blood price for me  

---

Slaughtered lamb,  
what atonement You bring!  
The vilest sinnerâ€™s heart  
Can be cleansed, can be free  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
Let songs of gratefulness  
Ever rise, never cease  

---

Loved by God  
and called as a saint  
My heart is satisfied  
In the riches of Christ  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing love I see  
What an amazing love I see  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing love I see  
What an amazing love I see  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me

#Resurrection Hymn

---

See what a morning,  
gloriously bright  
With the dawning  
Of hope in Jerusalem;  

---

Folded the grave-clothes  
Tomb filled with light,  
As the angels  
Announce Christ is risen  

---

See God's salvation plan,  
wrought in love,  
Borne in pain,  
paid in sacrifice,  

---

Fulfilled in Christ, the Man,  
for He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead  

---

See Mary weeping:  
Where is He laid?  
As in sorrow  
She turns from the empty tomb  

---

Hears a voice speaking,  
calling her name:  
It's the Master,   
The Lord raised to life again!  

---

The voice that spans the years,  
Speaking life,  
stirring hope,  
Bringing peace to us,  

---

Will sound till He appears,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!  

---

One with the Father,  
Ancient of Days,  
Through the Spirit  
Who clothes faith with certainty,  

---

Honor and blessing,  
glory and praise  
To the King crowned  
With power and authority!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead,  
love has won  
Christ has conquered;  

---

And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead,  
love has won  
Christ has conquered;  

---

And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives,  
Christ is risen  
from the dead!
