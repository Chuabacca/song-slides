#HIS MERCY IS MORE

---

WHAT LOVE COULD REMEMBER  
NO WRONGS WE HAVE DONE  
OMNISCIENT, ALL KNOWING,  

---

HE COUNTS NOT THEIR SUM  
THROWN IN TO A SEA  
WITHOUT BOTTOM OR SHORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

WHAT PATIENCE WOULD WAIT  
AS WE CONSTANTLY ROAM  
WHAT FATHER, SO TENDER,  

---

IS CALLING US HOME  
HE WELCOMES THE WEAKEST,  
THE VILEST, THE POOR  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
WHAT RICHES OF KINDNESS  

---

HE LAVISHED ON US  
HIS BLOOD WAS THE PAYMENT,  
HIS LIFE WAS THE COST  

---

WE STOOD ‘NEATH A DEBT  
WE COULD NEVER AFFORD  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS,  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE

# Wonderful, Merciful Savior

Wonderful, Merciful Savior  
Precious Redeemer and Friend  
Who would have thought that a lamb could  
Rescue the souls of men  
Oh, You Rescue the souls of men  

---

Counselor, Comforter, Keeper  
Spirit we long to embrace  
You offer hope when our hearts have  
Hopelessly lost our way  
Oh, we've hopelessly lost our way  

---

You are the One that we praise  
You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for  

---

Almighty, Infinite Father  
Faithfully loving Your own  
Here in our weakness You find us  
Falling before Your throne  
Oh, we're falling before Your throne  

---

You are the One that we praise  
You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for

Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for

#BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE

---

BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE  
I HAVE A STRONG AND PERFECT PLEA  
A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHOSE NAME IS LOVE  

---

WHO EVER LIVES AND PLEADS FOR ME  
MY NAME IS GRAVEN ON HIS HANDS  
MY NAME IS WRITTEN ON HIS HEART  

---

I KNOW THAT WHILE IN HEAV’N HE STANDS  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  

---

WHEN SATAN TEMPTS ME TO DESPAIR  
AND TELLS ME OF THE GUILT WITHIN  
UPWARD I LOOK AND SEE HIM THERE  

---

WHO MADE AN END OF ALL MY SIN  
BECAUSE THE SINLESS SAVIOUR DIED  
MY SINFUL SOUL IS COUNTED FREE  

---

FOR GOD THE JUST IS SATISFIED  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  

---

BEHOLD HIM THERE THE RISEN LAMB  
MY PERFECT SPOTLESS RIGHTEOUSNESS  
THE GREAT UNCHANGEABLE I AM  

---

THE KING OF GLORY AND OF GRACE  
ONE WITH HIMSELF I CANNOT DIE  
MY SOUL IS PURCHASED WITH HIS BLOOD  

---

MY LIFE IS HID WITH CHRIST ON HIGH  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  

---

I BOW BEFORE THE CROSS OF CHRIST  
AND MARVEL AT THIS LOVE DIVINE  
GOD’S PERFECT SON WAS SACRIFICED  

---

TO MAKE ME RIGHTEOUS IN GOD’S EYES  
THE RIVER’S DEPTH I CANNOT KNOW  
BUT I CAN GLORY IN ITS FLOOD  

---

THE LORD MOST HIGH IS BOWED DOWN LOW  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE
