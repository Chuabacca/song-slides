#The Lord is my Salvation

---

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  

---

The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine

#Here I Am to Worship

---

Light of the world,  
You stepped down into darkness.  
Opened my eyes, let me see.  

---

Beauty that made  
this heart adore You,  
Hope of a life spent with You  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

King of all days,  
Oh so highly exalted.  
Glorious in Heaven above  

---

Humbly You came  
to the earth You created.  
All for love's sake became poor  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross (3x)  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me
