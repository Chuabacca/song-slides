#Be Thou My Vision

---

*But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss  
for the sake of Christ.*  


---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

*Indeed, I count everything as loss  
because of the surpassing worth of  
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.* 

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

*For his sake I have suffered the loss of  
all things and count them as rubbish,  
in order that I may gain Christ*

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

*Not having a righteousness of my own  
that comes from the law,  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God that depends on faith*

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure, A promise so secure  
The mystery of God At last made known  
Treasures so vast appear, All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us the hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so true. A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice  
And when that life was nailed, On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with him was crucified  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so strong, that a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of hell could not defeat  
For Jesus rose again And if we died with him  
With him we’ll rise To share his endless life  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory

#For the Cause

---

For the cause of Christ the King  
We give our lives, an offering  
'Til all the earth resounds   
With ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause of Christ we go  
With joy to reap, with faith to sow  
As many see  
And many put their trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---
  
For the King once lifted high  
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'  
Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King who conquered death  
To free the poor and the oppressed  
For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  
  
---

*With full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.*  
  
*Philippians 1:20b-21*

---

Let it be my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ, to die is gain;  
Deny myself, take up my cross  
And follow the Son (2x) 


---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---

*And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”*  
  
*Matthew 28:18-20*
