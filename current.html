#Hallelujah for the Cross

---

Up to the hill  
of Calvary  
My Savior went  
courageously  

---

And there he  
bled and died for me  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

And on that day  
the world was changed  
A final, perfect lamb  
was slain  

---

Let earth and   
heaven now proclaim  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

What good I've done  
could never save  
My debt too great  
for deeds to pay  

---

But God,  
my Savior, made a way  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

A slave to sin,  
my life was bound  
But all my chains  
fell to the ground  

---

When Jesus' blood  
came flowing down  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

*For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.*  
  
##1 Corinthians 1:18

---

And when I breathe  
my final breath  
I'll have no need  
to fear that rest  

---

This hope will  
guide me into death  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah for the cross  
Hallelujah for the cross

#The Perfect Wisdom of Our God

---

*But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, so that, just as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”*  
  
##1 Corinthians 1:30-31

---

The perfect  
wisdom of our God  
Revealed in all  
the universe;  

---

All things  
created by His hand  
And held together  
at His command.  

---

He knows the  
mysteries of the seas,  
The secrets of the  
stars are His;  

---

He guides the  
planets on their way  
And turns the earth  
through another day.  

---

The matchless  
wisdom of His ways  
That mark the path  
of righteousness;  

---

His word a  
lamp unto my feet,  
His Spirit teaching  
and guiding me.  

---

And O the  
mystery of the cross,  
That God should suffer  
for the lost,  

---

So that the fool  
might shame the wise,  
And all the glory  
might go to Christ!  

---

O grant me  
wisdom from above,  
To pray for peace  
and cling to love,  

---

And teach me  
humbly to receive  
The sun and rain of  
Your sovereignty.  

---

Each strand of  
sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry  
of grace;  

---

So through the  
trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will  
in Your perfect way.”  

---

Each strand of  
sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry  
of grace;  

---

So through the  
trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will in  
Your perfect way.”
