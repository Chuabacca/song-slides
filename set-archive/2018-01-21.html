#Be Thou My Vision

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!
