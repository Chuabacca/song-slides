#This is Amazing Grace

Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?  
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.  

---

Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder,  
and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.

---

This is amazing grace,  
this is unfailing love,  
that You would take my place,  
that You would bear my cross.  

---

You laid down Your life,  
that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus, I sing for...  
all that You've done for me.

Who brings our chaos back into order?  
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?  
The King of Glory, the King of Glory.

Who rules the nations with truth and justice,  
shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings.

that You would bear my cross.

all that You've done for me.

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.  
Worthy, worthy, worthy, Oh...

#Be Thou My Vision

---

*But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss  
for the sake of Christ.*  


---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

*Indeed, I count everything as loss  
because of the surpassing worth of  
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.* 

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

*For his sake I have suffered the loss of  
all things and count them as rubbish,  
in order that I may gain Christ*

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

*Not having a righteousness of my own  
that comes from the law,  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God that depends on faith*

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure, A promise so secure  
The mystery of God At last made known  
Treasures so vast appear, All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us the hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so true. A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice  
And when that life was nailed, On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with him was crucified  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so strong, that a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of hell could not defeat  
For Jesus rose again And if we died with him  
With him we’ll rise To share his endless life  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory
