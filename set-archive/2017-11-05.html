#No Other Savior

---

Lord of every age, Author of our faith  
The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names  

---

Crowned in majesty,  
Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,  
The world at his command.  
The world at his command  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

Merciful High priest,  
Lover of the least  
Generous and meek,  
Protector of the weak

---

Sacrificed to death, For us,  
Your final breath  
You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.
