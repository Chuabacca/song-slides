#O Church Arise

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;  
Hear the call of Christ our captain.  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given.  

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.  
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,  
Reaching out to those in darkness.  

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,  
But to rage against the captor;  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,  
We will fight with faith and valor.  

---

When faced with trials on every side,  
We know the outcome is secure.  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:  
An inheritance of nations.   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,  
As the Son of God is stricken;  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,  
For the Conqueror has risen!  

---

And as the stone is rolled away,   
And Christ emerges from the grave,  
This victory march continues till the day  
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.  

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;  
Give grace for every hurdle.  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful.  

---

As saints of old, still line the way,  
Retelling triumphs of His grace,  
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day  
When with Christ we stand in Glory.  

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!   

---

Arise, shine for your light has come  
Arise, shine for the Risen Son  
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride  
Arise, o church arise!

###Psalm 96:7-9

Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples,  
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!  
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name;  
bring an offering, and come into his courts!  
Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness;  
tremble before him, all the earth!  

---

#For the Cause

---

For the cause of Christ the King  
We give our lives, an offering  
'Til all the earth resounds   
With ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause of Christ we go  
With joy to reap, with faith to sow  
As many see  
And many put their trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation,   
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation   
Through the Son!  

---
  
For the King once lifted high  
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'  
Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King who conquered death  
To free the poor and the oppressed  
For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation,   
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation   
Through the Son!  
  
---

Let it be my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ, to die is gain;  
Deny myself, take up my cross  
And follow the Son (2x) 


---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation,   
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation   
Through the Son!

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun

Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  

---

The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salva---tion

#The Glories of Calvary

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds 
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above 
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary
