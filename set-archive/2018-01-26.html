# Wonderful, Merciful Savior

Wonderful, Merciful Savior  
Precious Redeemer and Friend  
Who would have thought that a lamb could  
Rescue the souls of men  
Oh, You Rescue the souls of men  

---

Counselor, Comforter, Keeper  
Spirit we long to embrace  
You offer hope when our hearts have  
Hopelessly lost our way  
Oh, we've hopelessly lost our way  

---

You are the One that we praise  
You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for  

---

Almighty, Infinite Father  
Faithfully loving Your own  
Here in our weakness You find us  
Falling before Your throne  
Oh, we're falling before Your throne  

---

You are the One that we praise  
You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for

You are the One that we praise  
You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace

Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

#The Lord is my Salvation

---

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation
