#I Will Glory in My Redeemer

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who crushed the power of sin and death  
My only Savior before the Holy Judge  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
My life He bought, my love He owns  
I have no longings for another.  
I'm satisfied in Him alone

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
His faithfulness my standing place  
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me  
My feet are firm, held by His grace  
My feet are firm, held by His grace.  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who carries me on eagles' wings  
He crowns my life with lovingkindness.  
His triumph song  
I'll ever sing  
...I'll ever sing

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree

#Our Great God

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.
