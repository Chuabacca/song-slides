#The Glories of Calvary

---

##*Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more*
  
##*Romans 5:20*

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

##*so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.*
  
##*Romans 5:21*

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds  
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above  
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

##*Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory  *
  
##*1 Peter 1:8*

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.

#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure, A promise so secure  
The mystery of God At last made known  
Treasures so vast appear, All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us the hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so true. A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice  
And when that life was nailed, On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with him was crucified  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so strong, that a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of hell could not defeat  
For Jesus rose again And if we died with him  
With him weâ€™ll rise To share his endless life  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory

#Our Great God

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God
