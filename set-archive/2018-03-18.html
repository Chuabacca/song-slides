#Be Thou My Vision

---

*But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss  
for the sake of Christ.*  


---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

*Indeed, I count everything as loss  
because of the surpassing worth of  
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.* 

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

*For his sake I have suffered the loss of  
all things and count them as rubbish,  
in order that I may gain Christ*

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

*Not having a righteousness of my own  
that comes from the law,  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God that depends on faith*

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

#My Worth Is Not In What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own  
Not in the strength of flesh and bone  
But in the costly wounds of love  
At the cross  

---

My worth is not in skill or name  
In win or lose, in pride or shame  
But in the blood of Christ that flowed   
At the cross  

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

As summer flowers we fade and die  
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by  
But life eternal calls to us   
At the cross   

---

I will not boast in wealth or might   
Or human wisdom's fleeting light   
But I will boast in knowing Christ   
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

Two wonders here that I confess  
My worth and my unworthiness    
My value fixed - my ransom paid    
At the cross   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.   

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer  
Greatest Treasure,   
Wellspring of my soul  
I will trust in Him, no other.   
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

#Speak O Lord

---

Speak, O Lord, as we come to You  
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.  
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;  
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,  

---

That the light of Christ might be seen today  
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.  
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us   
All Your purposes for Your glory.  

---

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,  
Holy reverence, true humility;  
Test our thoughts and our attitudes  
In the radiance of Your purity.  

---

Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see  
Your majestic love and authority.  
Words of pow’r that can never fail—  
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.  

---

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;  
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us—  
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time  
That will echo down through eternity.  

---

And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises,  
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us.  
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built  
And the earth is filled with Your glory.  

---

And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises,  
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us.  
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built  
And the earth is filled with Your glory.
