#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.

#In Christ Alone

---

In Christ alone my hope is found,  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,  
Firm through the fiercest
drought and storm

---

What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All,  
Here in the love of Christ I stand

---

In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  

---

'Till on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live

---

There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again

---

And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

---

No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
...

#Your Name

---

As morning dawns and evening fades  
You inspire songs of praise  
That rise from earth to touch  
Your heart and glorify Your Name  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name  

---

Jesus, in Your Name we pray  
Come and fill our hearts today  
Lord, give us strength to live for You  
And glorify Your Name  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  

---

Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  

---

'Cause nothing has the power to save  
nothing has the power to save  
nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name  
...

#Jesus Messiah

---

He became sin who knew no sin.  
That we might become His righteousness  
He humbled himself and carried the cross.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing  

---

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

---

His body the bread, His blood the wine.  
Broken and poured out all for love.  
The whole earth trembled and the veil was torn.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing!

---

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

---

All our hope is in You.  
All our hope is in You.  
All the glory to You, God  
The light of the world

---

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

---

Jesus Messiah, Lord of all,  
The Lord of all  
The Lord of all
