#No Other Savior

Lord of every age, Author of our faith  
The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names

Crowned in majesty,  
Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,  
The world at his command.  
The world at his command

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

Merciful High priest,  
Lover of the least  
Generous and meek,  
Protector of the weak

Sacrificed to death, For us,  
Your final breath  
You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

#Anchored

---

My soul is anchored to Heav'n's holy veil,  
For Christ, the Great High Priest, Died in my stead.  
Hold fast! God's promise will never fail.  
We are His, For Christ has risen from the dead.  

---

No man or angel can keep me from Him.  
My hope in heaven is steadfast and firm.  
Though trials and suff'ring come, Death cannot win.  
So we live in light of our great King's return.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

In faith, my ransomed soul will ne'er depart  
From Christ, my Savior who freed me from sin.  
Rejoice! This confidence is sealed in our hearts  
By the Spirit who empow'rs us from within!  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Await with patience now, all those who long  
To join their Savior in Heav'n's endless days.  
A glorious time will come when all join the song,  
In one loud voice, "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.  

---

Your steadfast love Will lead us through the tempest.  
Grace and strength are ours.  
Your faithfulness Will see us through the storm  
And give us hope to carry on.

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

#For the Cause

---

For the cause of Christ the King  
We give our lives, an offering  
'Til all the earth resounds   
With ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause of Christ we go  
With joy to reap, with faith to sow  
As many see  
And many put their trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---
  
For the King once lifted high  
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'  
Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King who conquered death  
To free the poor and the oppressed  
For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  
  
---

Let it be my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ, to die is gain;  
Deny myself, take up my cross  
And follow the Son (2x) 


---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!
