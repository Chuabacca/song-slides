#God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

---

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
let nothing you dismay  
Remember, Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas Day  

---

To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

In Bethlehem, in Israel,  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
upon this blessed morn  

---

The which His Mother Mary  
did nothing take in scorn  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

From God our heav'nly Father,  
a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tiding of the same  

---

How that in Bethlehem was born  
the Son of God by name  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy   
...

#Jesus Joy of the Highest Heaven

---

Jesus, joy of the highest heaven,  
Born as a little baby  
Under a wondrous star.  

---

Like us, crying He takes His first breath  
Held by His mother, helpless  
Close to her beating heart.  

---

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,  
Facing a world of dangers,  
Come to turn me a stranger  
Into a child of God.  

---

Jesus, joy of the highest heaven,  
Born as a little baby  
Under a wondrous star.

Held by His mother, helpless  
Close to her beating heart.  

---

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,  
Facing a world of dangers,  
Come to turn me a stranger  
Into a child of God.  

---

Jesus, King of the highest heaven  
Learning to take His first steps,  
That He might bring us life.  

---

Like us, knowing our smiles and sorrows,  
He showed the way to follow,  
A way that is true and right.  

---

Jesus, take away every darkness,  
Steady my simple footsteps  
That I might in your goodness  
Live as a child of God.  

---

Steady my simple footsteps  
That I might in your goodness  
Live as a child of God.

Live as a child of God.
