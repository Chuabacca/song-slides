#The Lord is my Salvation

---

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  

---

The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine

The first, the last, the same.

Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,

To overcome the grave.
