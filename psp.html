#Our Great God

---

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory  
be to Our great God

#Think About It

---

Finally, brothers,  
whatever is true,  
whatever is noble,  
whatever is right  

---

Whatever is pure,  
whatever is lovely,  
whatever is admirable   
if anything is excellent  
or praiseworthy  

---

Think about such things,  
Think about such things.  
Think about, think about,  
think about such things.
