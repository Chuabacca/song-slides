Glory, hallelujah (2x)

#Our Great God

---

Eternal God unchanging  
mysterious and unknown  
your boundless love unfailing  
in grace and mercy shown  

---

Bright seraphim in endless flight  
around your glorious throne  
they raise their voices day and night  
in praise to you alone  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Lord we are weak and frail  
helpless in the storm  
Surround us with your angels  
hold us in your arms  

---

Our cold and ruthless enemy  
his pleasure is our harm  
Rise up oh Lord and he will flee  
before our sovereign God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Let every creature in the sea  
and every flying bird  
Let every mountain every field  
and valley of the earth  

---

Let all the moons and all the stars  
in all the universe  
Sing praises to the living God  
who rules them by his word  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  

---

Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God  
Hallelujah Glory be to Our great God

#Be Thou My Vision

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
