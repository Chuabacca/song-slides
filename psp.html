#Think About It

Finally, brothers,  
whatever is true,  
whatever is noble,  
whatever is right

Whatever is pure,  
whatever is lovely,  
whatever is admirable   
if anything is excellent  
or praiseworthy  

---

Think about such things,  
Think about such things.  
Think about, think about,

# Living Waters

---

Are you thirsty  
Are you empty  
Come and drink these living waters  
Tired and broken  
Peace unspoken  
Rest beside these living waters  

---

Christ is calling  
Find refreshing  
At the cross of living waters  
Lay your life down  
All the old gone  
Rise up in these living waters  

---

There’s a river that flows  
With mercy and love  
Bringing joy to the city of our God  
There our hope is secure  
Do not fear anymore  
Praise the Lord of living waters  

---

Spirit moving  
Mercy washing  
Healing in these living waters  
Lead your children  
To the shore line  
Life is in these living waters  

---

There’s a river that flows  
With mercy and love  
Bringing joy to the city of our God  
There our hope is secure  
Do not fear anymore  
Praise the Lord of living waters  

---

Are you thirsty  
Are you empty  
Come and drink these living waters  
Love, forgiveness  
Vast and boundless  
Christ, He is our living waters  

---

There’s a river that flows  
With mercy and love  
Bringing joy to the city of our God  
There our hope is secure  
Do not fear anymore  
Praise the Lord of living waters

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine
