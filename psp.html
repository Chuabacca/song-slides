#Here I Am to Worship

Light of the world,  
You stepped down into darkness.  
Opened my eyes, let me see.

Beauty that made  
this heart adore You,  
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

King of all days,  
Oh so highly exalted.  
Glorious in Heaven above

Humbly You came  
to the earth You created.  
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God

I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross (3x)

Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me

Wonderful, Merciful Savior  
Precious Redeemer and Friend

Rescue the souls of men  
Oh, You Rescue the souls of men

You offer hope when our hearts have  
Hopelessly lost our way  
Oh, we've hopelessly lost our way

You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for

Faithfully loving Your own  
Here in our weakness You find us  
Falling before Your throne  
Oh, we're falling before Your throne

You are the One we adore  
You give the healing and grace  
Our hearts always hunger for  
Oh, our hearts always hunger for
