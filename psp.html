Lord of every age, Author of our faith  
The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names

Crowned in majesty,  
Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at God's right hand,  
The world at his command.  
The world at his command

There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

Merciful High priest,  
Lover of the least  
Generous and meek,  
Protector of the weak

Sacrificed to death, For us,  
Your final breath  
You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine

#In Christ Alone

---

In Christ alone my hope is found,  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,  
Firm through the fiercest
drought and storm

---

What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All,  
Here in the love of Christ I stand

---

In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  

---

'Till on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live

---

There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again

---

And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

---

No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
