#Here I Am to Worship

---

Light of the world,  
You stepped down into darkness.  
Opened my eyes, let me see.  

---

Beauty that made  
this heart adore You,  
Hope of a life spent with You  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

King of all days,  
Oh so highly exalted.  
Glorious in Heaven above  

---

Humbly You came  
to the earth You created.  
All for love's sake became poor  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross (3x)  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me

#The Lord is my Salvation

---

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  

---

The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation

#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
