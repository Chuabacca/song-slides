#Hark the Herald Angels Sing

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King    
Peace on earth and mercy mild,   
God and sinners reconciled"   

---

Joyful all ye nations rise,   
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim,   
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"  

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"  

---
  
Christ, by highest heaven adored;   
Christ the everlasting Lord;   
Late in time behold him come,   
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.   

---

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;   
hail the incarnate Deity   
Pleased as man with men to dwell,   
Jesus, our Immanuel

#Angels We Have Heard On High

---

Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Shepherds why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heav'nly song  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn King  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

See within a manger laid  
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth  
Mary Joseph lend your aid  
With us sing our Savior's birth  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo
