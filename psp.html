#Think About It

---

Finally, brothers,  
whatever is true,  
whatever is noble,  
whatever is right  

---

Whatever is pure,  
whatever is lovely,  
whatever is admirable   
if anything is excellent  
or praiseworthy  

---

Think about such things,  
Think about such things.  
Think about, think about,  
think about such things.

#He is Our God

---

Who can light the fires  
of a thousand burning suns  
Blazing in the heavens  
There is only One  
He is our God  

---

Who commands the nations  
Building up and tearing down  
Silencing His rivals  
There is only One  
He is our God  

---

Holy  
You alone are holy  
Matchless in Your glory  
holy God  

---

Who would come to save us  
When we turned away His love  
Conquer us with kindness  

---

There is only One  
He is our God  
He is our God  

---

Holy  
You alone are holy  
Matchless in Your glory  
no on is like You  

---

Worthy  
You alone are worthy  
We adore You only  
holy God  

---

Now to the King  
on the throne  
Who was and is to come  
And to the Lamb  
who was slain be glory  

---

Now to the King  
on the throne  
Who was and is to come  
And to the Lamb  
who was slain be glory

#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
