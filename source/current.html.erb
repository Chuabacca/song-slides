*O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!*

---

*From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.*

---

*When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;*

---

*What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty!*

---

*You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field, The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,*

---

*Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth!*
##Psalm 8
