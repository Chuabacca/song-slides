But thanks be to God, 
that you who were once 
slaves of sin have 
become obedient from
the heart to the standard 
of teaching to which you 
were committed, and, 
having been set free 
from sin, have become 
slaves of righteousness.*
## Romans 6:17-18

Jesus answered them, â€œTruly, truly, 
I say to you, everyone who 
practices sin is a slave to sin. 
The slave does not remain in 
the house forever; the son 
remains forever. So if the Son 
sets you free, you will be free 
indeed.*
## John 8:34-36
