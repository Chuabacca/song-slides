# PSALM 1

---

*(1) Blessed is the man who walks not  
in the council of the wicked,  
nor stands in the way of sinners,  
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;*  

---

*(2) But his delight is in the law of    
the LORD, and on his law he    
meditates day and night.*    

---

*(3) He is like a tree planted by  
streams of water that yields its  
fruit in its season,*  

---

*and its leaf  
does not wither. In all that he    
does, he prospers.*    
  
---

*(4) The wicked are not so, but are  
like chaff that the wind drives  
away.*  
  
---

*(5) Therefore the wicked will not  
stand in the judgement, nor  
sinners in the congregation of  
the righteous;*  
  
---

*(6)for the LORD knows the way of  
the righteous, but the way of the    
wicked will perish.*
