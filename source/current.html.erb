PSALM 150  
PRAISE THE LORD!  
PRAISE GOD IN HIS SANCTUARY;  
PRAISE HIM IN HIS MIGHTY HEAVENS!  
PRAISE HIM FOR HIS MIGHTY DEEDS;  

---

PRAISE HIM FOR HIS EXCELLENT GREATNESS!  
PRAISE HIM WITH THE TRUMPET SOUND;  
PRAISE HIM WITH THE LUTE AND HARP!  
PRAISE HIM WITH TAMBOURINE AND DANCE;  

---

PRAISE HIM WITH STRINGS AND PIPE  
PRAISE HIM WITH SOUNDING CYMBALS;  
PRAISE HIM WITH LOUD CLASHING CYMBALS!  
LET EVERTHING THAT HAS BREATH PRAISE  
THE LORD!
