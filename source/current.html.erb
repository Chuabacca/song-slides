# Cornerstone Fellowship

---

*Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely.*

---

*and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith,*

---

*who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.*
### Hebrews 12:1â€“2
