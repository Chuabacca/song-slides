## PSALM 1

---

(1) Blessed is the man who walks not
in the council of the wicked,
nor stands in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

---

(2) But his delight is in the law of
the LORD, and on his law he
meditates day and night.

---

(3) He is like a tree planted by
streams of water that yields its
fruit in its season,

---

and its leaf
does not wither. In all that he
does, he prospers.

---

(4) The wicked are not so, but are
like chaff that the wind drives
away.

---

(5) Therefore the wicked will not
stand in the judgement, nor
sinners in the congregation of
the righteous;

---

(6) 
for the LORD knows the way of
the righteous, but the way of the
wicked will perish.
