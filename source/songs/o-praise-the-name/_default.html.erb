#O Praise the Name

---

I cast my mind to Calvary  
Where Jesus bled  
and died for me  

---

I see His wounds,  
His hands, His feet  
My Savior on  
that cursed tree  

---

His body bound and  
drenched in tears  
They laid Him down  
in Joseph's tomb  

---

The entrance sealed  
by heavy stone  
Messiah still  
and all alone

---

Then on the third  
at break of dawn  
The Son of heaven  
rose again  

---

O trampled death  
where is your sting?  
The angels roar  
for Christ the King  

---

---

He shall return  
in robes of white  
The blazing Son  
shall pierce the night  

---

And I will rise  
among the saints  
My gaze transfixed  
on Jesus' face
