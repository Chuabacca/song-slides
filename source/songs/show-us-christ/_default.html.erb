# Show Us Christ

---

Prepare our hearts, O God  
Help us to receive  
Break the hard and stony ground  
Help our unbelief  

---

Plant Your Word down deep in us  
Cause it to bear fruit  
Open up our ears to hear  
Lead us in Your truth  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Your Word is living light  
Upon our darkened eyes  
Guards us through temptations  
Makes the simple wise  

---

Your Word is food for famished ones  
Freedom for the slave  
Riches for the needy soul  
Come speak to us today  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Where else can we go, Lord  
Where else can we go  
You have the words of eternal life  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord  

---

Show us Christ, show us Christ  
O God, reveal Your glory  
Through the preaching of Your Word  
Until every heart confesses Christ is Lord
