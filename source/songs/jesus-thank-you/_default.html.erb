# Jesus Thank You

---

The mystr’y of the cross  
I cannot comprehend  
The agonies of Calvary  

---

You the perfect,  
Holy One crushed Your Son  
Who drank the bitter  
Cup reserved for me

By Your perfect sacrifice  
I’ve been brought near  
Your enemy you’ve made  
Your friend

---

Pouring out the riches  
Of Your glorious grace  
Your mercy and your  
kindness know no end
