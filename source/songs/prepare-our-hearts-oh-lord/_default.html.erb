#Prepare Our Hearts Oh Lord

PREPARE OUR HEARTS, OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

YOU PAID THE PRICE OF SIN,  
THROUGH YOUR BLOOD WE BEGIN  
TO SEE YOUR TRUTH,  
YOUâ€™VE PAID THE PRICE  

---

OH DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING?  
GRAVE WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY?  
BUT THANKS BE TO GOD,  
THROUGH YOU OH LORD  

---

PREPARE OUR HEARTS, OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

EVERY KNEE WILL BOW,   
CHRIST IS LORD!  
EVERY TONGUE CONFESS CHRIST IS LORD!  

---

YOU CALL OUR NAME OH LORD,  
YOU CALL OUR NAME SO CLEARLY  
THAT WE MIGHT BE PREPARED TO SEE YOUR FACE  

---

YOU OPEN OUR EYES AND EARS,  
O KNOW YOUR WORD SO CLEAR  
THAT WE MIGHT KNOW HOW NEAR,  
YOU REALLY ARE  

---
  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS OH LORD  
PREPARE OUR HEARTS TO BE WITH YOU  

---

EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW,  
CHRIST IS LORD!  
EVERY TONGUE CONFESS CHRIST IS LORD!  

---

CHRIST IS LORD!  
CHRIST IS LORD!   
CHRIST IS LORD!
