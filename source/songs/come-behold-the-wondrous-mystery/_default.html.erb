#Come Behold The Wondrous Mystery

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
In the dawning of the King  
He the theme of heaven’s praises  
Robed in frail humanity  

---

In our longing, in our darkness  
Now the light of life has come  
Look to Christ, who condescended  
Took on flesh to ransom us  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
He the perfect Son of Man  
In His living, in His suffering  
Never trace nor stain of sin  

---

See the true and better Adam  
Come to save the hell-bound man  
Christ the great and sure fulfillment  
Of the law; in Him we stand  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Christ the Lord upon the tree  
In the stead of ruined sinners  
Hangs the Lamb in victory  

---

See the price of our redemption  
See the Father’s plan unfold  
Bringing many sons to glory  
Grace unmeasured, love untold  

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Slain by death the God of life  
But no grave could e’er restrain Him  
Praise the Lord; He is alive!  

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected  
As we will be when he comes

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope

As we will be when he comes
