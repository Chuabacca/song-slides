#Think About It

---

Finally, brothers,  
whatever is true,  
whatever is noble,  
whatever is right  

---

Whatever is pure,  
whatever is lovely,  
whatever is admirable   
if anything is excellent  
or praiseworthy  

---

Think about such things,  
Think about such things.  
Think about, think about,  
think about such things.

Think-about, think-about,  
think about such things.
