#Power to Redeem

---

You take what is  
And you make it beautiful  
When love floods in,  
We're restored forever more  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

No guilt competes  
With innocence crucified.  
No grave can hold  
What your grace has justified.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

Rejoice O child of God
Lift your eyes to see  
With every morning light,  
Again we are redeemed (2x) 

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  

---

With breath that brings  
the dead to life,  
With words that pierce  
the dark with light  

---

Only by the blood are we set free.  
With mercy strong to carry  
shame and nail it to a tree  

---

You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.  
You alone hold the power to redeem.
