#Nothing But the Blood  

---

What can wash away my sin?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
What can make me whole again?  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
For my pardon this I see:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
For my cleansing this my plea:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
Nothing can for sin atone:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
Naught of good that I have done:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
This is all my hope and peace:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  
This is all my righteousness:  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.  

---
  
O precious is the flow  
that makes me white as snow;  
no other fount I know;  
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
