#For the Cause

---

For the cause  
of Christ the King  
We give our lives,  
an offering  

---

'Til all the earth  
resounds with  
ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause  
of Christ we go  
With joy to reap,  
with faith to sow  

---

As many see  
And many put their  
trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above  
every name:  

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  

---
  
For the King  
once lifted high  
To cries of rage,  
of 'crucify!'  

---

Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King  
who conquered death  
To free the poor  
and the oppressed  

---

For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  
  
---

Let it be  
my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ,  
to die is gain;  

---

Deny myself,  
take up my cross  
And follow the Son  

---

Let it be  
my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ,  
to die is gain;  

---

Deny myself,  
take up my cross  
And follow the Son  


---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!  

---

Christ we proclaim,  
The Name above  
every name:

---

For all creation,  
Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation  
through the Son!
