#For the Cause

---

For the cause of Christ the King  
We give our lives, an offering  
'Til all the earth resounds   
With ceaseless praise  
To the Son  

---

For the cause of Christ we go  
With joy to reap, with faith to sow  
As many see  
And many put their trust in the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!  

---
  
For the King once lifted high  
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'  
Endured the cross  
As every sin was laid  
On the Son  

---
  
To the King who conquered death  
To free the poor and the oppressed  
For lasting peace  
For life and liberty  
In the Son  

---

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!

*With full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.*  
  
*Philippians 1:20b-21*

---

Let it be my life's refrain:  
To live is Christ, to die is gain;  
Deny myself, take up my cross  
And follow the Son (2x)

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:  
For all creation, Ev'ry nation,  
God's salvation through the Son!

Christ we proclaim,   
The Name above every name:

God's salvation through the Son!

*And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”*  
  
*Matthew 28:18-20*
