#O Come O Come Emmanuel

---

O come, o come Emmanuel  
And ransom captive Israel  
That mourns in lowly exile here  
Until the Son of God appear  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  

---

O come, o come, Thou Lord of Might  
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height  
In ancient times didst give the law,  
In cloud, and majesty, and awe.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  

---

O come Thou Rod of Jesse, free  
Thine own from Satan's tyranny  
From depths of hell Thy people save  
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
O come Thou Dayspring come and cheer  

---

Our spirits by Thine advent here  
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night  
And death's dark shadows put to flight.  

---

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee O Israel  
...
