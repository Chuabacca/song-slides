Come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation  
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above  
Glory to God, glory in the highest

O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning  
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing

O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord

True God of true God, Light from Light eternal  
Humbly, He enters the virginâ€™s womb  
Son of the Father, begotten, not created  

---

O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord

For you alone are worthy  
For you alone are worthy  
For you alone are worthy  
Christ the Lord

We'll give you all the glory  
We'll give you all the glory  
We'll give you all the glory  
Christ the Lord
