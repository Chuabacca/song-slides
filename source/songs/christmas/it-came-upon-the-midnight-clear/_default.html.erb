#It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

---

It came upon the midnight clear,   
That glorious song of old.   
From angels bending near the earth,   
To touch their harps of gold;  

---

Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,   
From heaven's all gracious King!   
The world in solemn stillness lay,   
To hear the angels sing.  

---

He came down from His heav'nly throne   
into a world of death   
And with His perfect sacrifice   
the sinner now is blest  

---

Though as a Child in manger lay   
He still is Christ the King   
"All glory be to God on high!"   
The saints and angels sing  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,   
Whose forms are bending low,   
Who toil along the climbing way   
With painful steps and slow,  

---

Look now, for glad and golden hours   
Come swiftly on the wing   
And rest beside the weary road   
And hear the angels sing.  

---

For lo, the days are hastening on,   
By prophets seen of old  
When with the ever circling years   
Shall come the time foretold  

---

When peace shall over   
all the earth Its ancient splendors fling,  
And the whole world send back the song  
Which now the angels sing.  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  
Hear the angels sing  

---

Though as a Child in manger lay   
He still is Christ the King   
"All glory be to God on high!"   
The saints and angels sing  
...
