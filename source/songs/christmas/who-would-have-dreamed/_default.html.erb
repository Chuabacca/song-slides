#Who Would Have Dreamed

---

On a starlit hillside,  
shepherds watched their sheep  
Slowly, David’s city  
drifted off to sleep  

---

But to this little  
town of no great renown  
The Lord had a  
promise to keep  

---

Prophets had foretold it,  
a mighty King would come  
Long awaited Ruler,  
God’s Anointed One  

---

But the Sovereign of all  
looked helpless and small  
As God gave the world  
His own Son

---

Wondrous gift of heaven:  
the Father sends the Son  
Planned from time eternal,  
moved by holy love  

---

He will carry our curse  
and death He’ll reverse  
So we can be  
daughters and sons
