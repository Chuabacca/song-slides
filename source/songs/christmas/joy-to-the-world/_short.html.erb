Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room

And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and heav'n and  na - ture sing

He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness

And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders and wonders of His love

Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room

And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and heav'n and  na - ture sing
