Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room

And heav'n and nature sing

Joy to the earth the Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks hills and plains

Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

Joy, unspeakable joy  
An overflowing well  
No tongue can tell

Joy, unspeakable joy  
Rises in my soul  
Never lets me go  

---

He rules the world  
with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  

---

And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders and wonders of His love  

---

Joy, unspeakable joy  
An overflowing well  
No tongue can tell

Joy, unspeakable joy  
Rises in my soul  
Never lets me go
