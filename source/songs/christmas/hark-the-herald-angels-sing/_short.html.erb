#Hark the Herald Angels Sing

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King    
Peace on earth and mercy mild,   
God and sinners reconciled"   

---

Joyful all ye nations rise,   
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim,   
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"  

---

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored;   
Christ the everlasting Lord;   
Late in time behold him come,   
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.   

---

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;   
hail the incarnate Deity   
Pleased as man with men to dwell,   
Jesus, our Immanuel
