#Hark the Herald Angels Sing

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King    
Peace on earth and mercy mild,   
God and sinners reconciledâ€œ

Joyful all ye nations rise,   
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim,   
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"

Hark the herald angels sing,   
"Glory to the new born King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored;   
Christ the everlasting Lord;   
Late in time behold him come,   
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.   

---

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;   
hail the incarnate Deity   
Pleased as man with men to dwell,   
Jesus, our Immanuel

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace.   
Hail the son of Righteousness   
Light and life to all He brings,   
risen with healing in His wings  

---

Mild He lays His glory by,   
born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth,   
born to give them second birth
