#His Name is Wonderful

Come see the baby,  
crib for a bed  
His mother Mary  
lay down His sweet head

The starlight was shining,  
the wise men were led  
Come see the baby

And worship Him     
His name is    
Wonderful, Counselor    
Mighty God, Prince of Peace

Everlasting Father  
Em- man - u -el   
Holy One, Son of God  
Savior of the world

Come and adore Him  
on bended knee   
He came to ransom  
someone like me   

---

What could I offer?  
What could I bring?  
Come and adore Him

And all goodwill
