#Jesus Joy of the Highest Heaven

---

Jesus, joy of the highest heaven,  
Born as a little baby  
Under a wondrous star.  

---

Like us, crying He takes His first breath  
Held by His mother, helpless  
Close to her beating heart.  

---

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,  
Facing a world of dangers,  
Come to turn me a stranger  
Into a child of God.

Jesus, King of the highest heaven  
Learning to take His first steps,  
That He might bring us life.  

---

Like us, knowing our smiles and sorrows,  
He showed the way to follow,  
A way that is true and right.  

---

Jesus, take away every darkness,  
Steady my simple footsteps  
That I might in your goodness  
Live as a child of God.
