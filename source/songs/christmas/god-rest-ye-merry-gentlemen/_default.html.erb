#God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

---

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
let nothing you dismay  
Remember, Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas Day  

---

To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

In Bethlehem, in Israel,  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
upon this blessed morn  

---

The which His Mother Mary  
did nothing take in scorn  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

From God our heav'nly Father,  
a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tiding of the same  

---

How that in Bethlehem was born  
the Son of God by name  
O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy  

---

O, tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy  
O, tidings of comfort and joy
