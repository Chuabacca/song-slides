#Angels We Have Heard On High

---

Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Shepherds why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heav'nly song  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

Come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn King  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  

---

See within a manger laid  
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth  
Mary Joseph lend your aid  
With us sing our Savior's birth  

---

Gloria  
in excelsis Deo  
Gloria  
in excelsis Deo
