#Go Tell it on the Mountain

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept there watching  
O'er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shown a holy light

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born

The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth  

---

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born

Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

---

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hill and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  

---

That Jesus Christ is born  
That Jesus Christ is born  
That Jesus Christ is born
