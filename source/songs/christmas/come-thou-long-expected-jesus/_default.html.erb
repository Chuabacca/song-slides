#Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus

---

Come Thou long-expected Jesus  
Born to set Thy people free  
From our fears and sins release us  
Let us find our rest in Thee  

---

Israel's strength and consolation  
Hope of all the earth Thou art  
Dear desire of every nation  
Joy of every longing heart  

---

Joy to those who long to see thee  
Dayspring from on high, appear;  
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse  
of Thy birth we long to hear!  

---

O’er the hills the angels singing   
News, glad tidings of a birth  
“Go to him, your praises bringing;   
Christ the Lord has come to Earth.”  

---

Come to earth to taste our sadness,   
He whose glories knew no end;  
by His life He brings us gladness  
Our redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.   

---

Leaving riches without number,   
born within a cattle stall;  
This the everlasting wonder  
Christ was born the Lord of all!  

---

Born Thy people to deliver  
Born a child and yet a King  
Born to reign in us forever  
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring  

---

By Thine own eternal Spirit  
Rule in all our hearts alone    
By Thine all-sufficient merit  
Raise us to Thy glorious throne  
...
