#The Hippo Song

---

In the beginning  
God made the seas  
And the forests  
filled with trees  

---

He built the  
mountains up so high  
At the very top  
he placed the sky  

---

God's fingerprints  
are everywhere  
Just to show  
how much he cares  

---

In between he had  
loads of fun  
He made the hippo  
that weighs a ton  

---

Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus  
hip-hip Hooray!  
God made all of us!  

---

Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus  
hip-hip Hooray!  
God made all of us!

In the beginning

God's fingerprints

Just to show

Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus  
hip-hip Hooray!

Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus

God made all of us!
