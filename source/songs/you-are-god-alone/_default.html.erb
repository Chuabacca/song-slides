#You Are God Alone

---

You are not a God created  
by human hands  
You are not a God dependant  
on any mortal man  

---

You are not a God in need of  
anything we can give  
By Your plan  
that’s just the way it is  

---

You are not a God created  
by human hands  
You are not a God dependant  
on any mortal man  

---

You are not a God in need of  
anything we can give  
By Your plan  
that’s just the way it is  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

You’re the only God whose power  
none can contend  
You’re the only God  
whose name and praise will never end  

---

You’re the only God whose worthy of  
everything we can give  
You are God that’s just the way it is  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  
Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  

---

You are God alone  
from before time began  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

And right now  
in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
You are God alone  

---

Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are  
Unchangable, unshakable, unstoppable  
that’s what You are
