#Hallelujah for the Cross

---

Up to the hill  
of Calvary  
My Savior went  
courageously  

---

And there he  
bled and died for me  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

And on that day  
the world was changed  
A final, perfect lamb  
was slain  

---

Let earth and   
heaven now proclaim  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

What good I've done  
could never save  
My debt too great  
for deeds to pay  

---

But God,  
my Savior, made a way  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

A slave to sin,  
my life was bound  
But all my chains  
fell to the ground  

---

When Jesus' blood  
came flowing down  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

*For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.*  
  
##1 Corinthians 1:18

---

And when I breathe  
my final breath  
I'll have no need  
to fear that rest  

---

This hope will  
guide me into death  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah  
for the war He fought  
Love has won,  
death has lost  

---

Hallelujah   
for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

Hallelujah for the cross
