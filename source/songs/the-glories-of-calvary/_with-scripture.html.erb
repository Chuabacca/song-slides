Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above  
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb

Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me

Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me
