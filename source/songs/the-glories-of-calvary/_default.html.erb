#The Glories of Calvary

---

Lord, You're calling me to come  
and behold the wondrous cross  
To explore the depths of grace  
that came to me at such a cost 

---

Where Your boundless love  
conquered my boundless sin  
And mercy's arms were opened wide

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

Sinners find eternal joy  
in the triumph of Your wounds 
By our Savior's crimson flow  
Holy wrath has been removed 

---

And Your saints below  
join with your saints above 
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary

---

For all eternity we will sing worthy  
Our God has set us free  
We'll sing the glories of Calvary (3x)

---

My heart is filled with a thousand songs  
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary  
With every breath, Lord how I long  
To sing of Jesus who died for me  
Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary
