#Here I Am to Worship

---

Light of the world,  
You stepped down into darkness.  
Opened my eyes, let me see.  

---

Beauty that made  
this heart adore You,  
Hope of a life spent with You  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

King of all days,  
Oh so highly exalted.  
Glorious in Heaven above  

---

Humbly You came  
to the earth You created.  
All for love's sake became poor  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross (3x)  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me  

---

Here I am to worship,  
Here I am to bow down.  
Here I am to say that  
You're my God  

---

You're altogether lovely,  
Altogether worthy,  
Altogether wonderful to me
