#The Heart of Worship

---

WHEN THE MUSIC FADES,  
ALL IS STRIPPED AWAY,  
AND I SIMPLY COME  

---

LONGING JUST TO BRING,  
SOMETHING THAT’S OF WORTH  
THAT WILL BLESS YOUR HEART  

---

I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG,  
FOR A SONG IN ITSELF  
IS NOT WHAT YOU HAVE REQUIRED  

---

YOU SEARCH MUCH DEEPER WITHIN,  
THROUGH THE WAY THINGS APPEAR,  
YOU’RE LOOKING INTO MY HEART  

---

I’M COMING BACK TO THE   
HEART OF WORSHIP  
AND IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’M SORRY LORD FOR THE   
THING I’VE MADE IT  
WHEN IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

KING OF ENDLESS WORTH,  
NO ONE COULD EXPRESS  
HOW MUCH YOU DESERVE  

---
 
THOUGH I’M WEAK AND POOR,    
ALL I HAVE IS YOURS    
EVER SINGLE BREATH    
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG,    
FOR A SONG IN ITSELF    

---

IS NOT WHAT YOU HAVE REQUIRED    
YOU SEARCH MUCH DEEPER WITHIN,    
THROUGH THE WAY THINGS APPEAR    
YOU’RE LOOKING INTO MY HEART    

---

I’M COMING BACK TO THE  
HEART OF WORSHIP  
AND IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’M SORRY LORD FOR THE  
THING I’VE MADE IT  
WHEN IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU,  
ALL ABOUT YOU JESUS  

---

I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
  
---
  
YOUR LOOKING INTO MY HEART,  
INTO MY HEART  
YOUR LOOKING INTO MY HEART  
INTO MY HEART  
  
---
  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG  
I’LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG
