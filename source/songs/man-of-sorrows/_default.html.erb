# Man of Sorrows

---
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

---

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  

---

Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  

---

Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  

---

Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honor unto Thee  
Praise and honor unto Thee
