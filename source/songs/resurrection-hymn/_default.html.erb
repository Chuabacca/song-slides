#Resurrection Hymn

---

See what a morning, gloriously bright  
With the dawning  
Of hope in Jerusalem;  

---

Folded the grave-clothes  
Tomb filled with light,  
As the angels  
Announce Christ is risen  

---

See God's salvation plan,  
wrought in love,  
Borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,  
Fulfilled in Christ, the Man, for He lives,  
Christ is risen from the dead  

---

See Mary weeping: 'Where is He laid?  
As in sorrow  
She turns from the empty tomb;  

---

Hears a voice speaking, calling her name:  
It's the Master,   
The Lord raised to life again!  

---

The voice that spans the years,  
Speaking life, stirring hope,  
Bringing peace to us,  
Will sound till He appears,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!  

---

One with the Father, Ancient of Days,  
Through the Spirit  
Who clothes faith with certainty,  

---

Honor and blessing, glory and praise  
To the King crowned  
With power and authority!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead, love has won  
Christ has conquered;  
And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!  

---

And we are raised with Him,  
Death is dead, love has won  
Christ has conquered;  
And we shall reign with Him,  
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
