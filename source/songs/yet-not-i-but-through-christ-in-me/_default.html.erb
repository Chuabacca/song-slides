#Yet Not I, But Through Christ in Me

---

What gift of grace, is Jesus my Redeemer  
There is no more, for heaven now to give  
He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom  
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
For my life is wholly bound to His  
Oh how strange and divine,  
I can sing all is mine!

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.  
For by my side, the Savior He will stay  
I labor on, in weakness and rejoicing  
For in my need His power is displayed.

---

To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me  
Through the deepest valley He will lead  
Oh the night has been won,  
and I shall overcome!

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.  
The future sure, the price it has been paid.  
For Jesus bled, and suffered for my pardon  
And He was raised to overcome the grave.

---

To this I hold, my sin has been defeated  
Jesus now and evermore my plea  
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am  
Free! Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

With every breath, I long to follow Jesus.  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day, I know He will renew me  
Until I stand, with joy before the throne

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.  
All the glory evermore to Him.  
When the race is complete, still my lips  
shall repeat

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me

---

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him.  
When the race is complete,  
still my lips shall repeat

---

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

---

When the race is complete,  
still my lips shall repeat:  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in Me!
