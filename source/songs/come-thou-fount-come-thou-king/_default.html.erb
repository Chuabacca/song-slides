# Come Thou Fount, Come Thou King

---

Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing  
Tune My Heart To Sing Thy Grace  
Streams Of Mercy Never Ceasing  
Call For songs Of Loudest Praise  

---

Teach Me Some Melodious Sonnet  
Sung By Flaming Tongues Above  
Praise The Mount I'm Fixed Upon it  
Mount of Thy Redeeming Love  

---

I Was Lost In Utter Darkness  
Till You Came And Rescued Me  
I Was Bound By All My Sin When  
Your Love Came And Rescued Me  

---

Now My Soul Can Sing A New Song  
Now My Heart Has Found A Home  
Now Your Grace Is Always With Me  
And I'll Never Be alone  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

O To Grace How Great A Debtor  
Daily I'm Constrained To Be  
Let Thy Goodness Like a Fetter  
Bind My Wandering Heart To Thee  

---

Prone To Wander Lord I Feel It  
Prone To Leave The God I Love  
Here's My Heart Lord Take And Seal It  
Seal It For Thy Courts Above  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing  

---

Come Thou Fount Come Thou King  
Come Thou Precious Prince Of Peace  
Hear Your Bride To You We Sing  
Come Thou Fount Of Our Blessing

I Was Lost In Utter Darkness  
â€˜Til You Came And Rescued Me  
I Was Bound By All My Sin When  
Your Love Came And Set Me Free  

---

Now My Soul Can Sing A New Song  
Now My Heart Has Found A Home  
Now Your Grace Is Always with Me  
And I'll Never Be Alone
