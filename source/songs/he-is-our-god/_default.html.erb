#He is Our God

Who can light the fires  
of a thousand burning suns  
Blazing in the heavens  

---

There is only One  
He is our God

Who commands the nations  
Building up and tearing down  
Silencing His rivals  

---

There is only One  
He is our God  

---

Holy  
You alone are holy  
Matchless in Your glory  
holy God  

---

Who would come to save us  
When we turned away His love  
Conquer us with kindness  

---

There is only One  
He is our God  
He is our God

You alone are holy  
Matchless in Your glory  
no on is like You

We adore You only

Now to the King  
on the throne  
Who was and is to come  
And to the Lamb  
who was slain be glory

Who was and is to come  
And to the Lamb  
who was slain be glory

And to the Lamb
