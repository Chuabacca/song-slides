#Now Why This Fear?

---

Now why this fear and unbelief  
Has not the Father put to grief  
His spotless Son for us  

---

And will the righteous Judge of men  
Condemn me for that debt of sin  
now canceled at the cross  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

Complete atonement You have made  
And by Your death have fully paid  
The debt Your people owed  

---

No wrath remains for us to face  
We're sheltered by Your saving grace  
And sprinkled with Your blood  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

Be still my soul and know this peace  
The merits of your great high priest  
Have bought your liberty  

---

Rely then on His precious blood  
Don't fear your banishment from God  
Since Jesus sets you free  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

How sweet the sound of saving grace  
How sweet the sound of saving grace  
Christ died for me  

---

Je- - -sus all my trust  
is in Your blood  
Je- - -sus You've rescued us  
through Your great love
