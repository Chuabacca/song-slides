# How Great is Our God

The splendor of a King,  
clothed in majesty  
Let all the Earth rejoice  
All the Earth rejoice

He wraps himself in light  
And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice

And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end

The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb
