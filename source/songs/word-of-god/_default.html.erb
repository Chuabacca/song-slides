#Word of God

---

The Word of God is  
light in my darkness  
Hope for the hopeless,  
strong and true  

---

The Word of God is  
strength for the weary  
a shield for those who  
trust in You  
a shield for those who  
trust in You  

---

Everything will fade,  
everything will fade  
The heavens and the  
earth will pass away  

---

But You will remain,  
yes You will remain  
always  

---

Jesus, faithful  
Word of God  
The anchor of my heart  
You're everything You  
say You are (Lord)  

---

Greater than my deepest needs  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your promises won't  
fail me now
