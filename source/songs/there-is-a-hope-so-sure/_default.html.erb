#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure,  
A promise so secure  
The mystery of God  
At last made known  

---

Treasures so vast appear,  
All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us  
The hope of glory!

There is a life so true.  
A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a  
Perfect sacrifice  

---

And when that life was nailed,  
On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with  
Him was crucified

---

There is a life so strong,  
That a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of  
Hell could not defeat  

---

For Jesus rose again  
And if we died with him  
With him weâ€™ll rise  
To share his endless life

Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me  
The hope of glory
