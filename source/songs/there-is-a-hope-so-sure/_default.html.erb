#There is a Hope So Sure

---

There is a hope so sure, A promise so secure  
The mystery of God At last made known  
Treasures so vast appear, All wisdom, knowledge here  
It's Christ in us the hope of glory!  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so true. A life of love so pure  
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice  
And when that life was nailed, On cruel cross impaled  
Our sinful flesh with him was crucified  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

There is a life so strong, that a whole world of wrong  
And all the powers of hell could not defeat  
For Jesus rose again And if we died with him  
With him weâ€™ll rise To share his endless life  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  

---

And the life that I now live  
No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
And each day I live No longer is my own  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory  
Jesus lives in me the hope of glory
