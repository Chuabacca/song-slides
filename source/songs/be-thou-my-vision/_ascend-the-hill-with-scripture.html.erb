#Be Thou My Vision

---

*But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss  
for the sake of Christ.*  


---

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

---

*Indeed, I count everything as loss  
because of the surpassing worth of  
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.* 

---

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  

---

*For his sake I have suffered the loss of  
all things and count them as rubbish,  
in order that I may gain Christ*

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart,  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

*Not having a righteousness of my own  
that comes from the law,  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God that depends on faith*

---

High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.  

---

Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight  
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied  

---

Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
