#Grace and Peace

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
For lawbreakers and thieves  
For the worthless, the least  

---

You have said,  
that our judgment is death  
For all eternity  
Without hope,  
without rest  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
The matchless King of all  
Paid the blood price for me  

---

Slaughtered lamb,  
what atonement You bring!  
The vilest sinnerâ€™s heart  
Can be cleansed, can be free  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Grace and peace,  
oh how can this be  
Let songs of gratefulness  
Ever rise, never cease  

---

Loved by God  
and called as a saint  
My heart is satisfied  
In the riches of Christ  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing love I see  
What an amazing love I see  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing love I see  
What an amazing love I see  
That Your grace has come to me  

---

Oh, what an amazing mystery  
What an amazing mystery  
That Your grace has come to me
