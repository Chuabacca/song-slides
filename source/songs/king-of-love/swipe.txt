The King of Love my Shepherd is  
Whose goodness faileth never  
I nothing lack if I am His   
And He is mine forever  
And He is mine forever

Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth  
And where the verdant pastures grow  
With food celestial feedeth

Never failing, Ruler of my heart  
Everlasting, Lover of my soul  
On the mountain high or in the valley low  
The King of Love my Shepherd is  
The King of Love my Shepherd is

Lost and foolish off I strayed  
But yet in love He sought me  
And on His shoulder gently laid  
And home rejoicing brought me

In deathâ€™s dark veil I fear no ill  
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me  
Thy rod and staff my comfort still  
Thy cross before to guide me

Never failing, Ruler of my heart  
Everlasting, Lover of my soul  
On the mountain high or in the valley low  
The King of Love my Shepherd is  
The King of Love my Shepherd is

Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Never failing, Ruler of my heart  
Everlasting, Lover of my soul  
On the mountain high or in the valley low  
The King of Love my Shepherd is

Never failing, Ruler of my heart  
Everlasting, Lover of my soul  
On the mountain high or in the valley low  
The King of Love my Shepherd is  
The King of Love my Shepherd is

And so through all the length of days  
Thy goodness faileth never  
Good Shepherd, may I sing Your praise  
Within Your house forever  
Within Your house forever
