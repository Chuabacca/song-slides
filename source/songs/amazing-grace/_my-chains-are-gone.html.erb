#Amazing Grace
#(My Chains Are Gone)

---

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  

---

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
as long as life endures  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace  

---

My chains are gone, I've been set free  
my God my Savior has ransomed me  
and like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love Amazing Grace

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,  
The sun forbear to shine;  
But God, who call'd me here below,  
Will be forever mine   
Will be forever mine 
You are forever mine
