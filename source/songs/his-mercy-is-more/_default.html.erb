#HIS MERCY IS MORE

---

WHAT LOVE COULD REMEMBER  
NO WRONGS WE HAVE DONE  
OMNISCIENT, ALL KNOWING,  

---

HE COUNTS NOT THEIR SUM  
THROWN IN TO A SEA  
WITHOUT BOTTOM OR SHORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

WHAT PATIENCE WOULD WAIT  
AS WE CONSTANTLY ROAM  
WHAT FATHER, SO TENDER,  

---

IS CALLING US HOME  
HE WELCOMES THE WEAKEST,  
THE VILEST, THE POOR  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  
WHAT RICHES OF KINDNESS  

---

HE LAVISHED ON US  
HIS BLOOD WAS THE PAYMENT,  
HIS LIFE WAS THE COST  

---

WE STOOD ‘NEATH A DEBT  
WE COULD NEVER AFFORD  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
PRAISE THE LORD,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

STRONGER THAN DARKNESS,  
NEW EVERY MORN’  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY  

---

HIS MERCY IS MORE  
OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE  

---

OUR SINS THEY ARE MANY,  
HIS MERCY IS MORE
