#His Mercy is More

---

What love could remember  
No wrongs we have done  
Omniscient, all knowing,  

---

He counts not their sum  
Thrown in to a sea  
Without bottom or shore  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

What patience would wait  
As we constantly roam  
What father, so tender,  

---

Is calling us home  
He welcomes the weakest,  
The vilest, the poor  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord  

---

His mercy is more  
Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  
What riches of kindness  

---

He lavished on us  
His blood was the payment,  
His life was the cost  

---

We stood ‘neath a debt  
We could never afford  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Praise the Lord,  
His mercy is more  

---

Stronger than darkness,  
New every morn’  
Our sins they are many  

---

His mercy is more  
Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more  

---

Our sins they are many,  
His mercy is more
