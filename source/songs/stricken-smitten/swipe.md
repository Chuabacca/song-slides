# Stricken Smitten and Afflicted

Stricken smitten and afflicted  
See Him dying on the tree  
‘Tis the Christ by man rejected  
Yes my soul ‘tis He ‘tis He

'Tis the long expected Prophet  
David's Son yet David's Lord  
By His Son, God now has spoken  
'Tis the true and faithful Word

Tell me ye who hear Him groaning  
Was there ever grief like His  
Friends in fear His cause disowning  
Foes insulting His distress  

<-
***
->

Many hands were raised to wound Him  
None would interpose to save  
Yet the deepest stroke that pierced Him  
Was the stroke that justice gave  

<-

Ye who think of sin but lightly  
Nor suppose the evil great  
Here may view its nature rightly  
Here its guilt may estimate  

<-

->

Mark the sacrifice appointed  
See who bears the awful load  
'Tis the Word the Lord's Anointed  
Son of Man and Son of God  

<-

Here we have a firm foundation  
Here the refuge of the lost  
Christ's the Rock of our salvation  
His the name on which we boast  

<-
***
->

Lamb of God for sinners wounded  
Sacrifice to cancel guilt  
None shall ever be confounded  
Who on Him their hope have built

'Tis the long expected Prophet  
David's Son yet David's Lord  
By His Son, God now has spoken  
'Tis the true and faithful Word
