#There is a Redeemer

There is a Redeemer  
Jesus God’s own Son  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Holy one

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done

Jesus my Redeemer  
Name above all names  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Oh for sinners slain  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done  

---

When I stand in glory  
I will see his face  
There i’ll serve my king forever  
In that holy place  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done  

---

Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us your Son  
And leaving your Spirit till  
The work on earth is done
