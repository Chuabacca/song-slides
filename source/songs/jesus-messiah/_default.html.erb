#Jesus Messiah

He became sin who knew no sin.  
That we might become His righteousness  
He humbled himself and carried the cross.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing

Jesus Messiah, name above all names  
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel  
The Rescue for Sinners, The Ransom from Heaven  
Jesus Messiah, Lord of All

---

His body the bread, His blood the wine.  
Broken and poured out all for love.  
The whole earth trembled and the veil was torn.  
Love so amazing, love so amazing!
