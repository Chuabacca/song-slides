#The Perfect Wisdom of Our God

---

*But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, so that, just as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”*  
  
##1 Corinthians 1:30-31

---

The perfect  
wisdom of our God  
Revealed in all  
the universe;  

---

All things  
created by His hand  
And held together  
at His command.  

---

He knows the  
mysteries of the seas,  
The secrets of the  
stars are His;  

---

He guides the  
planets on their way  
And turns the earth  
through another day.  

---

The matchless  
wisdom of His ways  
That mark the path  
of righteousness;  

---

His word a  
lamp unto my feet,  
His Spirit teaching  
and guiding me.  

---

And O the  
mystery of the cross,  
That God should suffer  
for the lost,  

---

So that the fool  
might shame the wise,  
And all the glory  
might go to Christ!  

---

O grant me  
wisdom from above,  
To pray for peace  
and cling to love,  

---

And teach me  
humbly to receive  
The sun and rain of  
Your sovereignty.  

---

Each strand of  
sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry  
of grace;  

---

So through the  
trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will  
in Your perfect way.”  

---

Each strand of  
sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry  
of grace;  

---

So through the  
trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will in  
Your perfect way.”
