#The Perfect Wisdom of Our God

---

The perfect wisdom of our God  
Revealed in all the universe;  
All things created by His hand  
And held together at His command.  

---

He knows the mysteries of the seas,  
The secrets of the stars are His;  
He guides the planets on their way  
And turns the earth through another day.  

---

The matchless wisdom of His ways  
That mark the path of righteousness;  
His word a lamp unto my feet,  
His Spirit teaching and guiding me.  

---

And O the mystery of the cross,  
That God should suffer for the lost,  
So that the fool might shame the wise,  
And all the glory might go to Christ!  

---

O grant me wisdom from above,  
To pray for peace and cling to love,  
And teach me humbly to receive  
The sun and rain of Your sovereignty.  

---

Each strand of sorrow has a place  
Within this tapestry of grace;  
So through the trials I choose to say:  
“Your perfect will in Your perfect way.”
