#The Lord is my Salvation

---

The grace of God has reached for me  
And pulled me from the raging sea  
And I am safe on this solid ground  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

I will not fear when darkness falls  
His strength will help me scale these walls  
I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

My hope is hidden in the Lord  
He flow’rs each promise of His Word  
When winter fades I know spring will come  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

In times of waiting, times of need  
When I know loss, when I am weak  
I know His grace will renew these days  
The Lord is my salvation   

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

And when I reach my final day  
He will not leave me in the grave  
But I will rise,   
He will call me home  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Who is like the Lord our God?  
Strong to save, faithful in love  
My debt is paid and the vict’ry won  
The Lord is my salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit  
The Lord is our salvation  

---

Glory be to God the Father  
Glory be to God the Son  
Glory be to God the Spirit

The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation  
The Lord is our salvation
