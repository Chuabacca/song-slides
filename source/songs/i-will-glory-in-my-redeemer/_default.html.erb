#I Will Glory in My Redeemer

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who crushed the power of sin and death  
My only Savior before the Holy Judge  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
My life He bought, my love He owns  
I have no longings for another.  
I'm satisfied in Him alone

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
His faithfulness my standing place  
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me  
My feet are firm, held by His grace  
My feet are firm, held by His grace.

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who carries me on eagles' wings  
He crowns my life with lovingkindness.  
His triumph song  
I'll ever sing  
...I'll ever sing

---

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold

I will glory in my Redeemer.  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails,  
And hung Him on that judgment tree
