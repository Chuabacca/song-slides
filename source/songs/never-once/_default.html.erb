#Never Once

---

Standing on this mountain top  
Looking just how far we’ve come  
Knowing that for every step  
You were with us  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much you’ve done  
Knowing every victory  
Is your power in us  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Never once did we ever walk alone  

---

Carried by your constant grace  
Held within your perfect peace  
Never once, no we never walk alone  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Every step we are breathing in your grace  
Evermore we’ll be  
Breathing out your praise  

---

You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  

---

Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did you leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God you are faithful  
You are faithful, God you are faithful!
