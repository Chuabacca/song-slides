#NEVER ONCE

---

STANDING ON THIS MOUNTAIN TOP  
LOOKING JUST HOW FAR WE’VE COME  
KNOWING THAT FOR EVERY STEP  
YOU WERE WITH US  

---

KNEELING ON THIS BATTLE GROUND  
SEEING JUST HOW MUCH YOU’VE DONE  
KNOWING EVERY VICTORY  
IS YOUR POWER IN US  

---

SCARS AND STRUGGLES ON THE WAY  
BUT WITH JOY OUR HEARTS CAN SAY  
YES, OUR HEARTS CAN SAY  

---

NEVER ONCE DID WE EVER WALK ALONE  
NEVER ONCE DID YOU LEAVE US ON OUR OWN  
YOU ARE FAITHFUL, GOD YOU ARE FAITHFUL
