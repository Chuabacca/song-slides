#Behold Our God

---

Who has held the oceans in His hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at His voice  
All creation rises to rejoice  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of His words?  
Who can teach the One who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

Who has felt the nails upon His hands?  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man  
God eternal, humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign  

---

Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him  

---

You will reign forever 4x  
(Let Your glory fill the earth) 4x
