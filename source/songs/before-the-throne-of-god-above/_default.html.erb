#Before The Throne Of God Above

---

Before the throne of God above  
I have a strong and perfect plea  
A great high priest whose name is love  

---

Who ever lives and pleads for me  
My name is graven on his hands  
My name is written on his heart  

---

I know that while in heav’n he stands  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  

---

When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see him there  

---

Who made an end of all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  

---

For God the just is satisfied  
To look on him and pardon me  
To look on him and pardon me  

---

Behold him there the risen Lamb  
My perfect spotless righteousness  
The great unchangeable I AM  

---

The King of glory and of grace  
One with himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased with his blood  

---

My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God  
With Christ my Savior and my God  

---

I bow before the cross of Christ  
And marvel at this love divine  
God’s perfect on was sacrificed  

---

To make me righteous in God’s eyes  
The river’s depth I cannot know  
But I can glory in its flood  

---

The Lord most high is bowed down low  
And poured on me his glorious love  
And poured on me his glorious love  
And poured on me his glorious love
