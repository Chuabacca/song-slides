#BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE

BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE  
I HAVE A STRONG AND PERFECT PLEA  
A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHOSE NAME IS LOVE  

---

WHO EVER LIVES AND PLEADS FOR ME  
MY NAME IS GRAVEN ON HIS HANDS  
MY NAME IS WRITTEN ON HIS HEART  

---

I KNOW THAT WHILE IN HEAV’N HE STANDS  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  
NO TONGUE CAN BID ME THENCE DEPART  

---

WHEN SATAN TEMPTS ME TO DESPAIR  
AND TELLS ME OF THE GUILT WITHIN  
UPWARD I LOOK AND SEE HIM THERE  

---

WHO MADE AN END OF ALL MY SIN  
BECAUSE THE SINLESS SAVIOUR DIED  
MY SINFUL SOUL IS COUNTED FREE  

---

FOR GOD THE JUST IS SATISFIED  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  
TO LOOK ON HIM AND PARDON ME  

---

BEHOLD HIM THERE THE RISEN LAMB  
MY PERFECT SPOTLESS RIGHTEOUSNESS  
THE GREAT UNCHANGEABLE I AM  

---

THE KING OF GLORY AND OF GRACE  
ONE WITH HIMSELF I CANNOT DIE  
MY SOUL IS PURCHASED WITH HIS BLOOD  

---

MY LIFE IS HID WITH CHRIST ON HIGH  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  
WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOUR AND MY GOD  

---

I BOW BEFORE THE CROSS OF CHRIST  
AND MARVEL AT THIS LOVE DIVINE  
GOD’S PERFECT SON WAS SACRIFICED  

---

TO MAKE ME RIGHTEOUS IN GOD’S EYES  
THE RIVER’S DEPTH I CANNOT KNOW  
BUT I CAN GLORY IN ITS FLOOD  

---

THE LORD MOST HIGH IS BOWED DOWN LOW  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE  
AND POURED ON ME HIS GLORIOUS LOVE
