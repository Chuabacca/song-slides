#No Other Savior

---

Lord of every age, Author of our faith  
The first, the last, the same.  
The name above all names  

---

Crowned in majesty, Glorious Prince of Peace  
Enthroned at Godâ€™s right hand,  
The world at his command. The world at his command  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

Merciful High priest,  
Lover of the least  
Generous and meek, Protector of the weak

---

Sacrificed to death, For us,  
Your final breath  
You died, the world to save,  
To overcome the grave.  
To overcome the grave

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior

---

You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  
You will reign forever  
You reign forever  

---

Jesus, Lamb of God, How great you are  
There is no other Savior  
Every knee bows down, At your renown.  
There is no other Savior
