# Be Thou My Vision

---

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

---

Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

---

O God be my everything, be my delight
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)

---

High King of heaven, my vict’ry won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

---

O God be my everything, be my delight
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)

---

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

# My Worth is Not in What I Own

---

My worth is not in what I own
Not in the strength of flesh and bone
But in the costly wounds of love
At the cross

---

My worth is not in skill or name
In win or lose, in pride or shame
But in the blood of Christ that flowed 
At the cross

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure, 
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other. 
My soul is satisfied in Him alone. 

---

As summer flowers we fade and die
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by
But life eternal calls to us 
At the cross 

---

I will not boast in wealth or might
Or human wisdom’s fleeting light
But I will boast in knowing Christ
At the cross

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure, 
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other. 
My soul is satisfied in Him alone. 

---

Two wonders here that I confess
My worth and my unworthiness
My value fixed - my ransom paid
At the cross

---

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure, 
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other. 
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

#O Church Arise (Arise, Shine)

---

O church, arise, and put your armor on;
Hear the call of Christ our captain.
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given.

---

With shield of faith and belt of truth,
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies.
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,
Reaching out to those in darkness.

---

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
But to rage against the captor;
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,
We will fight with faith and valor.

---

When faced with trials on every side,
We know the outcome is secure.
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:
An inheritance of nations. 

---

Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise! 

---

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
As the Son of God is stricken;
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
For the Conqueror has risen!

---

And as the stone is rolled away, 
And Christ emerges from the grave,
This victory march continues till the day
Ev’ry eye and heart shall see Him.

---

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;
Give grace for every hurdle.
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful.

---

As saints of old, still line the way,
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
When with Christ we stand in Glory.

---

Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise! 

---

Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!
