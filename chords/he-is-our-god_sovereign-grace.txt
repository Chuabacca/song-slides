INTRO
[ A D 2x]

VERSE 1
[A]Who can light the fires
of a thousand burning suns
Blazing in the heavens
There is only One
He is [D]our God

VERSE 2
[A]Who commands the nations
Building up and tearing down
Silencing His rivals
There is only One
He is [D]our God

CHORUS 1
[A]Holy You alone are [D]holy
Matchless in Your [Esus]glory [D]holy God

VERSE 3
[A]Who would come to save us
When we turned away His love
Conquer us with kindness
There is only One
He is [D]our God He is [A]our God

CHORUS 2
[A]Holy You alone are [D]holy
Matchless in Your [Esus]glory [D]holy God
[A]Worthy You alone are [D]worthy
We adore You [Esus]only [D]holy God [A]

BRIDGE
[F#m]Now to the King on the [D]throne
Who was and is to [A]come
And to the Lamb who was [G#m/E]slain be glory (3x)

{CHORUS 1, 2}
